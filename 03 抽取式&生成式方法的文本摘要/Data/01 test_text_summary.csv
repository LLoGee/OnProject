(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 1911 cubist painting ""The Hairdresser,"" worth millions of dollars, was reported missing from a Pompidou storeroom in 2001. It was smuggled into the U.S. in December from Belgium. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pompidou director Alain Seban said the discovery comes as a ""true comfort"" at a time when the cultural world is reeling from an Islamic State video showing the destruction of statues in Iraq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seban said in a statement Friday that he hopes the work can be exhibited again publicly in May. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. and French authorities have not announced any arrests in the case.  A stolen Picasso worth millions of dollars was shipped to the U.S. in a package that described it as a $37 ""art craft"" — but it will soon be on its way back to France. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn filed papers Thursday to forfeit the century-old cubist painting, which was swiped from a museum storeroom in 2001. ""A lost treasure has been found,"" U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The canvas, titled ""La Coiffeuse,"" was bequeathed to France's National Museum and was placed in storage at the Centre Georges Pompidou, where staffers discovered it was missing when they received a loan request for it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was shipped by Federal Express from Belgium in December and seized at the Port of Newark. Officials said shipper was identified only as ""Robert"" and the destination was a climate-controlled storage facility in Queens.

The canvas had been smuggled out of a storeroom of the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Paris museum and arts center, and its whereabouts had not been known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, filed a civil complaint to forfeit the Picasso and return it to France. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its shipping papers described it as a $37 “art craft/toy” and also read “Joyeux Noel,” French for “Merry Christmas.” When federal Customs and Border Protection officials examined the shipment, though, they found the master artist’s work. Department of Homeland Security officials working from Long Island City, Queens, which is within the Eastern District of New York’s jurisdiction, then took over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The oil painting is owned by the French government; it had been bequeathed to the National Museums of France by one of its former directors. It was last exhibited in Munich in 1998, and then returned to Paris, where it was stored at the Pompidou. Officials there thought it was safe and sound until they received a loan request for it in 2001, searched the storerooms and could not find it. They declared the painting, then valued more than $2.5 million, stolen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 17, someone going by “Robert” with an address in Belgium shipped the painting to a climate-controlled warehouse in Long Island City. The next day, the painting arrived at the Port of Newark and was seized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR French museum officials came to New York last month to examine the painting in person alongside historical records and photographs, and they confirmed that it was “La Coiffeuse.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under federal law, imported merchandise can be seized by the government if it was stolen or smuggled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The market to sell stolen antiquities in the United States is drying up,” Anthony Scandiffio, deputy special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations, which seized the painting after border officials flagged it, said in a statement.","A Picasso painting that was found to have vanished from a Paris museum more than a decade ago has turned up—in the US, in a package shipped from Belgium. Its papers identified it as a $37 ""art craft/toy"" and also included the line ""Joyeux Noel,"" or Merry Christmas, the New York Times reports. A man named ""Robert"" attempted to send the package to a climate-controlled warehouse in Queens, New York, in December, but custom officials at the Port of Newark seized what turned out to be Picasso's 1911 La Coiffeuse (The Hairdresser). French museum officials traveled to New York last month and confirmed the find is indeed the missing Picasso work, which the Centre Georges Pompidou realized was missing from its storerooms in 2001 following a loan request; it was then valued at more than $2.5 million. Court documents don't specify whether the sender or would-be recipient have been identified, NBC News reports, but ""a lost treasure has been found,"" US attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. She filed a civil complaint yesterday that will have the painting returned to France. The Pompidou's director, who called the painting's rediscovery a ""true comfort,"" hopes the painting can go on display at the museum as early as May, the AP reports. (Another Picasso work was stolen days before this one was found.)"

Just a day after the attack, the CIA's reports were already referencing al-Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb. The following day, David Petraeus appeared before House and Senate groups; he, too, mentioned the terrorists, and was asked to compile unclassified talking points that Congress could use. By noon on Sept. 14, a draft was circulating—and it referenced al-Qaeda. But an exhausting process of editing followed, with more than two dozen CIA officials weighing in on the copy over email—and battling about the inclusion of al-Qaeda. Those opposed argued it should be removed because the intel was shaky (sourced from intercepted phone calls) and over fears it could alert al-Qaeda members to the fact that they were being watched. The opponents won out, though the term ""extremists"" remained; the FBI agreed with the call. It also contained this line: ""The demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the US Embassy in Cairo."" On Sept. 15, the CIA station chief in Tripoli began to voice his concern with the assertions that the attack was both spontaneous and that demonstrations were occurring.

The Raleigh News & Observer says that Deena Murphy and Timothy Sullivan agreed to participate in the hit HGTV series under the guise that they were considering a move to a rental property with their teenage foster children. The problem, according to the suit against Big Coat TV and Aaron Fitz Construction, was that the show’s principals—designer Hilary Farr, real estate agent David Visentin, and contractor Eric Eremita—are “actors or television personalities playing a role for the camera,” not people who “played more than a casual role in the actual renovation process.” While this shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s ever suffered through Farr and Visentin’s bullshit “no, you are” banter, it’s still mildly disheartening to hear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the episode, which aired in April 2015, Murphy and Sullivan were asked to deposit $140,000 into a fund with the production company, who would later use that money to pay Fitz and other subcontractors. According to the suit, the couple voiced its concerns about Fitz, saying it had below-average reviews on Angie’s List, but they were ignored. Over the course of the renovations, only $85,780.50 was disbursed to Fitz, leaving the couple wondering where the rest of their money went. The suit also questions how Big Coat can operate as a general contractor, a role it’s not licensed for. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murphy and Sullivan are also claiming that Love It Or List It is even more of a scam than it generally seems, with the couple saying the show never used a licensed architect to develop plans for their house, and that they were never shown houses that were actually for sale in North Carolina—or for sale by any licensed North Carolina real estate broker. They also say any work done on the show was work that they’d previously made plans for with another company, Werx-Design Build. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the suit, the actual work done on the house was “disastrous,” leaving the home “irreparably damaged.” Duct work was left open, leading to vermin entering the house, and the couple complains of “low-grade industrial carpeting, unpainted surfaces, and windows painted shut.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the News & Observer summarizes, “Big Coat’s purported agreement,” the lawsuit contends, ‘admits that it is in the business of television production, not construction. ... The homeowners’ funds essentially pay the cost of creating a stage set for this television series.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria Armstrong, Big Coat’s CEO and the show’s executive producer, says that the company intends to “vigorously defend what [it] consider[s] false allegations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Submit your Newswire tips here.","When Deena Murphy and Timothy Sullivan wanted to renovate their Raleigh, NC, rental property, they didn't want a DIY project, so they did what they thought was the next best thing: signed up to have an HGTV show do it for them. But per a lawsuit the couple has now filed against Big Coat, the production company behind Love It or List It, as well as the local contractor who overhauled the home, they were left with ""disastrous work,"" including holes in the floor and windows painted shut, the Charlotte Observer reports. The suit also alleges the ""reality-TV"" program is ""scripted, with 'roles' and reactions assigned to the various performers and participants, including the homeowners."" And the show's hosts, designer Hilary Farr and real estate agent David Visentin, and its resident general contractor? ""Actors or television personalities … [who don't play] more than a casual role in the actual renovation process."" Per their contract with Big Coat, the couple deposited $140,000 that would be used to pay Aaron Fitz Construction and its subcontractors. About $85,000 was distributed to Aaron Fitz during the overhaul, even though Murphy and Sullivan say they expressed concerns about mediocre reviews seen on Angie's List. The rest of the money got pumped into producing the show, the couple claims, reports Today.com. They say the show is ""even more of a scam than it generally seems,"" as the AV Club frames it.

"Anissa Weier is brought into court for a hearing last month. On Thursday, her attorney said she would plead not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect in the Slender Man case. She and Morgan Geyser are accused of stabbing another girl. (Photo: Michael Sears / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anissa Weier plans to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect in the Slender Man stabbing case next week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weier's co-defendant, Morgan Geyser, had already entered such a plea, often referred to as NGI, at a hearing last month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, prosecutors pressed the judge to inquire whether Weier might go the same route, since it requires the court to appoint doctors to examine the defendant and report whether their condition would support the plea. One of Weier's attorneys, Maura McMahon, said the defense had not yet decided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a pleading filed this week, McMahon indicated that Weier now wants to change her not guilty plea to the insanity plea. A hearing was set for Sept. 9 for that change of plea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weier and Geyser, both 14, were 12 when prosecutors say they plotted and attempted to kill their sixth-grade classmate and friend Payton Leutner in May 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ARCHIVE: Slender Man case coverage NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leutner was stabbed 19 times and left for dead in a Waukesha park the morning after a sleepover party for Geyser's 12th birthday, but managed to crawl near a path, where she was found by a passing bicyclist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both defendants later told police they were trying to either impress or avoid the wrath of Slender Man, a fictional internet boogeyman the girls said they believed would harm them or their families if they didn't kill their friend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They remain charged as adults with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, after efforts to have their cases transferred to juvenile court were denied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A defendant entering an NGI plea contends that at the time she committed a crime, a mental disease or defect prevented her from appreciating the wrongfulness of her action, or from conforming her conduct to the law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Someone found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect is typically committed to a state mental hospital for treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Geyser, who has been diagnosed with early onset schizophrenia, has already spent months at Winnebago Mental Health Institute under a separate civil commitment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During earlier hearings, mental health experts testified that Weier was competent to proceed with the case, but had not done more extensive evaluations required for an NGI review. She remains at a West Bend juvenile detention center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No trial date has been set in the case.

"ROME — If the paragon of all Christmas trees is the one in front of the Rockefeller Center in New York — first erected, mind you, by an Italian in 1931 — the prize for most pitiful must go to the one that stands in Rome’s Piazza Venezia this year. Just days after it was put up, it began to gray and shed its needles, and soon it had become nearly see-through. The tree cuts so sad and forlorn a figure that it has been nicknamed Spelacchio, or Mangy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spelacchio arrived in Rome early this month from the Trentino region, near Italy’s border with Austria, and what with transport expenses and decorations, the 70-foot fir is estimated to have cost Italian taxpayers 48,000 euros, or $57,000. It’s not clear what has ailed it. Maybe Spelacchio was unsettled by the trip; perhaps it was ill on departure. By way of explanation, Antimo Palumbo, a tree historian who was standing by Spelacchio’s side on Friday morning, pointed at the concrete all over its roots. “You see that?” he told me. “They decided to pour the concrete to keep it steady, but that killed it instead.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There isn’t enough time, money or political will to replace the tree, and so Spelacchio the Mangy will stay in Piazza Venezia through the holidays, and for many locals it has already become a metaphor for what’s wrong with the city, and the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Traffic in Rome is chronically congested, public transport is inefficient, trash collection is slow and sporadic.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tree was quickly nicknamed Spelacchio, or Mangy, because so many of its dead needles were dropping off, leaving the tree looking a bit bare. Chatter spread quickly on social media where Romans traded jokes about the spruce and criticized its sad appearance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Insults quickly turned to intrigue as the Italian media plumbed the tree’s costs, questioned how it had been transported to the city and analyzed its state of health. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It has clearly been traumatized,” one expert declared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A consumer rights group asked an administrative court, which has oversight over government spending, to investigate what it described as a “shameful spectacle for citizens and tourists” and demanded that the tree be removed immediately.

The New York Times reports that the 72-foot-tall Norway spruce erected in the Piazza Venezia and nicknamed ""Spelacchio,"" or ""Mangy,"" will cost the city about $57,000 in all—and locals are outraged that so much money was outlayed for a tree that one expert says ""has clearly been traumatized."" Thrillist documents some of the online reaction to the sad, needle-sparse spruce, which it calls a ""balding network of pines and brittle branches."" ""Maybe the dogs drank all the water in the tree stand?"" one amused viewer tweeted, while another offered a backhanded compliment: ""Big fan of Rome's Christmas tree for looking how we all feel."" Others defend the tree, saying it looks OK when it's lit up at night. ""We are all Spelacchio!"" one supporter told a local paper. Per the Times, the tree even has a few Facebook accounts and a Twitter handle in its name, with one tweet proclaiming: ""I have more followers than branches."" A consumer rights group that calls the tree a ""shameful spectacle for citizens and tourists"" is lobbying to have the tree taken down and has asked a local court to scrutinize the tree's costs.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first lady declined a personal adviser's suggestion that she address Jesus Christ, however, because it would be ""too personal,"" according to Woodward's book, ""The Choice."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book, which is still to be published, takes a behind-the-scenes look at the Clintons, as well as Bob and Elizabeth Dole. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Woodward says the adviser was Jean Houston, co-director of the Foundation for Mind Research, which he describes as a group that studies the psychic experience and altered and expanded consciousness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book portrays Houston as an influential adviser who urged Mrs. Clinton to write her book, ""It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children Teach Us,"" and in the process ""virtually moved into the White House"" for days at a time to help with revisions, the Sun-Times reported.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Most people in the White House did not know about Hillary's sessions with Houston. ...

"Ardent Donald Trump supporter, Scott Baio, was allegedly physically attacked by the wife of a Red Hot Chili Peppers band member for supporting the president-elect.

Mack’s husband has been vocal about being anti-Donald Trump, citing him as a racist. Baio is one of Trump’s strongest celebrity supporters in Hollywood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the report, Scott Baio told police that he asked Nancy Mack to keep it down because kids were present, but she didn’t back down. The wife of the Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer demanded to know how he could support a man who said, “Grab ’em by the pu**y.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baio says she repeatedly screamed, “Grab ’em by the pu**y.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scott asked Nancy to stop, but she continued screaming the comment. He said at that point, Mack began attacked him physically by grabbing him under his arms, shaking, and pushing him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sources close to Nancy Mack claim she was mimicking how Donald Trump hugs women and meant no actual harm against Scott Baio. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ventura County Sheriff’s Department is reportedly investigating the incident. Mack is listed as a battery suspect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scott Baio has taken a lot of heat for being a Donald Trump supporter, but he’s dished a lot of it back to critics. Throughout the campaign, people were on Twitter issuing threats and he was one of the rare celebrities who voiced his support for the Republican president-elect. He spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention, saying in his speech that Hillary Clinton wanted the presidency only for herself, not for the American people.

An interview he gave to Virgin Radio was transcribed by Alternative Nation, in which he called Trump supporters “uneducated whites” who vote for a “sexual predator.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The people in America are white, uneducated, and they’re sick of Washington politics, and they think in their uneducated minds that any change is better than continuing with the same kind of politicians we have,” Smith said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Smith referenced the comments Trump made about feeling entitled to grab women by the genitals because of his fame, he said Trump could kill someone and his supporters would still vote for him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What’s scariest about it is that people who support him don’t care,” continued the Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer. “He could probably come out in the next month and say he murdered somebody, and they’d still vote for him. It’s insane, it’s insanity. It’s disgusting, it’s a bummer.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To most everyone’s surprise, Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency on November 8. A number of celebrities claimed they’d leave the country if Trump won, but are staying put. Among those who vowed to move if Trump won were Chelsea Handler, Rosie O’Donnell, Amy Schumer, Cher, Jon Stewart, and Bryan Cranston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scott Baio is accustomed to dealing with anti-Trump protesters, but this the first time someone has gotten physical with him over his support of the president-elect. More celebrities in Hollywood align themselves with the political views of the Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer and his wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Featured Image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images]  When half the entertainment industry lives in the same city, you're bound to hear about odd and occasionally antagonistic celebrity combinations from time to time. Today's example: Nancy Mack, wife of Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith , is being accused of physically assaulting actor Scott Baio . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their alleged confrontation, per TMZ , took place at an event hosted by the elementary school attended by children of both families. According to Baio, it stemmed from a political disagreement rooted in his outspoken support of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mack, who's been equally public in her disdain for Trump, is accused of confronting Baio at the function by ""berating and cursing"" him, specifically by referencing the archival recording that made headlines during the election after it surfaced and revealed Trump discussing the many ways in which women make themselves available to male celebrities. Baio reportedly claims he asked Mack to calm down in the interest of the children present; TMZ 's sources say she was ""undeterred,"" and continued to loudly repeat Trump's taped claim that he could ""grab"" women ""by the p----."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baio apparently told police the argument turned physical when Mack grabbed, shook, and pushed him — an accusation Mack has reportedly refuted by saying ""she was merely trying to show Baio how Trump hugs women."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ventura County Sheriff's Department is said to be investigating the incident and eyeing Mack as a battery suspect. While both parties are known for their active social media presences, neither Baio nor Mack have commented publicly as of this writing.","It sounds like a bunch of random words strung together, but it's a real news article: Scott Baio claims that during an elementary school function in Thousand Oaks, Calif., Saturday, the wife of the Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer started cussing him out and then physically attacked him. Baio, aka Charles in Charge and/or Chachi, filed a police report over the incident, and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department is investigating, TMZ reports. Baio is a Donald Trump supporter; Nancy Mack is not, and she allegedly wanted to know how Baio could vote for someone who would talk about grabbing women ""by the pussy."" Baio says he asked her to stop screaming because kids, including his daughter and a child or children of Mack's, were around, but she kept doing so, using curse words and repeating the above-mentioned ""pussy"" comment. He says she then grabbed him underneath his arms, shook him, and pushed him. But sources close to Mack say any such movements were simply an attempt to illustrate, for Baio's education, how Trump hugs women. The Inquisitr notes that Mack's husband, Chad Smith, has publicly denounced Trump, saying his backers are ""uneducated whites"" who voted a ""sexual predator"" into office."
"North Korea on Friday secured its presence at South Korea's Pyeongchang Olympics in February with figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik grabbing one of the last qualifying spots on offer at the Nebelhorn trophy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pair's Olympic qualification is seen as positive development amid an escalating crisis on the Korean peninsula and the potential complications this could have for the Games. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The International Olympic Committee was eager to have North Korean athletes at the Games and has been supporting several of them in terms of equipment, travel and accommodation in their efforts to qualify. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korean speed skaters and Nordic skiers could join the figure skaters with their own qualifiers coming up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pyongyang natives successfully completed a solid short program to music by the Beatles on Thursday and produced an even better free skate performance to ""Je suis qu'une chanson"" to make sure of one of five Olympic qualifying spots on offer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kim pumped his fists at the end of their routine, hugging his partner before a team official wrapped a jacket over him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The International Skating Union (ISU) confirmed their qualification for Pyeongchang, with Russia and Germany, who were top, having already qualified for the Games in South Korea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The final decision regarding their Olympic participation rests with the North Korean Olympic committee which needs to give the green light. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea did not have any athletes at the 2014 Sochi winter Games. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tension on the Korean peninsula has risen in recent weeks as North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump exchanged war-like threats and insults over the North's nuclear and missile development program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North has accused Trump of declaring war after he warned Kim's regime would not last if he persisted in threatening the United States and its allies, having earlier warned North Korea would be totally destroyed in such an event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in July the North will be given until the last minute to decide whether it will take part in the Olympics.  Story highlights Pair are first North Korean athletes to qualify for 2018 Winter Olympics NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Winter Olympics will be held in South Korea from 9-25 February NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (CNN) In the small Bavarian ski-town of Oberstdorf, figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-sik became the first North Korean athletes to qualify for South Korea's 2018 Winter Olympics -- a development that could have diplomatic implications as well as sporting ones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pair -- who perform to the music of The Beatles and have been training in Canada -- produced an impressive free-skate performance to secure one of the final Olympic spots up for grabs at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany in September. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ryom, 18, and 25-year-old Kim finished 15th at the World Championships last season and spent the summer training in Montreal under French coach, Bruno Marcotte. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their qualification will be welcome news to South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, who earlier this month told CNN that North Korean participation in PyeongChang will ""provide a very good opportunity for inter-Korean peace and reconciliation."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read More  The two nations have been on convivial sporting terms this year — North Korea sent its women’s hockey team and a taekwondo team to compete in the South — but the Olympics have never gone forward free of geopolitics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul, the South Korean capital. And North Korea’s current leader, Kim Jong-un, is highly unpredictable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the skaters were asked minutes after Friday’s performance if they hoped to compete at the Games, their coach, Kim Hyon-son, stepped in and said, “It is up to the North Korean Olympic Committee to decide whether they will participate or not.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North Koreans appeared relaxed and open — to a point — at a second meeting with reporters after the competition here, the Nebelhorn Trophy, but requested that no questions be asked about the Olympics. Their reluctance probably stemmed from the fact that the decision will not be theirs, said Bruno Marcotte, a prominent French Canadian coach who also works with the skaters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s out of their hands,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clearly, though, the outcome was important to North Korea. It has invested considerable time and money to make Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim eligible for the Winter Games and respected at the international level. The skaters trained over the summer in Montreal with Mr. Marcotte, whose wife, Meagan Duhamel, is a two-time world pairs champion. And the pressure of a suitable performance here seemed to weigh on Ri Chol-un, an official with the North Korean skating federation.","Amid rising nuclear tensions, two figure skaters Friday became the first North Korean athletes to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics, which will be held just 40 miles south of the demilitarized zone in South Korea, CNN reports. According to the New York Times, 18-year-old Ryom Tae-Ok and 25-year-old Kim Ju-Sik, who have been training in Canada with a French coach, finished with a score of 180.09 at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany. It was a career-best performance in an international competition for the pair. Kim says they were motivated by their coaches and the people cheering for them. Ryom agreed: ""There were many people of different nationalities and backgrounds cheering for us. The fact that we gave them some kind of joy, that was the best part in the performance."" While Kim and Ryom's sixth place finish in Germany was enough to nab them one of the final spots in February's Olympics, it remains unclear if they'll actually compete, Reuters reports. The decision rests with the North Korea Olympic Committee. Both South Korea and the International Olympic Committee have been pushing for North Korean athletes to participate in the Games, hoping it will be a diplomatic balm for the countries. The IOC has been providing travel, equipment, and accommodation to North Korean athletes attempting to qualify (North Korean skiers and speed skaters still have a shot), and South Korea's president said North Korea will have as much time as possible to decide if it will participate. North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in South Korea, but it did send a women's hockey team and taekwondo team to competitions in South Korea this year."

"The 12-year-old student that provided the THC-infused gummy candy that sent six students to the hospital faces seven felony charges and one misdemeanor charge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MULBERRY — Six Mulberry Middle School students were taken to the hospital after ingesting most of a 100-milligram block of THC-infused gummy candies Thursday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, Leviticus Jones, 12, somehow came into possession of the Green Hornet-brand gummies which, if taken as directed, would represent 10 individual doses. THC is the primary psychoactive chemical compound in cannabis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Detectives are investigating how Jones acquired the gummy candies, as recreational use and possession of THC without a state-issued medical card is illegal in Florida. Edible products, such as the candy, are not currently available from dispensaries under state medical marijuana rules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I warned us that all of this was coming,” Judd said in a press conference across from the school Thursday afternoon. Judd had been a staunch opponent of 2016's Amendment 2, the state constitutional amendment that made medical marijuana legal under state law, and earlier attempts by proponents for medical use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jones' parents are cooperating with investigators, Judd said, and understand the gravity of the situation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Judd said that Jones shared the gummies with some friends during gym class. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A total of six children in seventh grade partook, Judd said — two boys and four girls.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jones faces seven felony charges — six counts of distribution within 1,000 feet of a school and one on possession of cannabis resin — and a misdemeanor charge of possession of paraphernalia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Judd said all the children are going to make a “great recovery,” but added “obviously we are concerned how a 12-year-old could come into possession of this drug, this illegal drug in the state of Florida. And two, why did he offer it to these six kids, which quite frankly, with the exception of one little quarter left, have apparently devoured this bar during gym class?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Polk County Schools Superintendent Jacqueline Byrd said she applauds the staff for their quick response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When they heard something had happened with the students, they responded immediately,” she said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Byrd urged parents to monitor their children's online activity to see what they may be purchasing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The sheriff and I have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe,” Byrd said.

The New Jersey governor cut off Piers Morgan's Warren Buffett question at the pass in an interview last night on CNN, telling him, ""He should just write a check and shut up. Really, and just contribute. The fact of the matter is that I'm tired of hearing about it. If he wants to give the government more money, he's got the ability to write a check—go ahead and write it."" As Morgan protested that he hadn't heard the question, Christie said, ""I know the question. Do you really think Warren Buffett needs as much attention from the government as the most vulnerable?"" Christie relented a bit, notes Politico, saying that ""during difficult economic times you're most concerned about the people who have the potential to suffer the most,"" but that ""I'm not going to get into this class warfare business where certain people are more important than others."""

Ex-Wife Wants to Call the Shots NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXCLUSIVE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The woman Scott Weiland divorced nearly 9 years ago, and often battled over his drug use, is asking the courts to name her the executor of his will ... TMZ has learned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mary Forsberg filed docs in L.A. saying Scott himself named her as executor, and she's filed a will with his signature as proof. Here's the catch ... the will was written in April 2007. That's right around the time Scott and Mary's marriage was falling apart, and when he was in the throes of addiction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mary wrote a memoir called 'Fall to Pieces' about life with Scott and his battles with drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The docs say Scott had about $2 million in assets as part of his estate. He also created a trust during his lifetime that has undisclosed assets.

The mother of two penned her memories of Weiland and their marriage as well as his drug abuse in her memoir called Fall to Pieces. She also wrote an emotional letter in Rolling Stone days following Weiland's death. ""The truth is, like so many other kids, they lost their father years ago. What they truly lost on December 3rd was hope,"" she wrote with contributions from her kids.The former Velvet Revolver band member married his third wife Jamie Wachtel in 2013. Weiland's first wife is Janina Castenada, whom he was married to from 1994 - 2000.Weiland died at the age of 48 on Dec. 3 while on tour with his band The Wildabouts in Bloomington, Minnesota. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office in Minnesota said a mix of cocaine, ethanol (alcohol), and MDA (a relative of ecstasy) led to the rock star's death. The press release, obtained by PEOPLE , also mentioned Weiland's history of cardiovascular disease, asthma, and multi-substance dependence as ""significant conditions"".A hearing date has been set for Feb. 5.","Scott Weiland's death could end up just as fraught as his life. The late Stone Temple Pilots frontman's ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, has filed court documents in an attempt to be named executor of Weiland's will, People reports.

Forsberg says Weiland himself named her executor, and she filed a signed copy of his 2007 will as proof, TMZ reports. But, as the gossip site notes, their marriage was falling apart right around that time, and Weiland was ""in the throes of addiction."" Wachtel could contest the filing.

We may have to wait a bit longer than usual for the next season of Game of Thrones, and there’s a very good reason: The show needs winter to actually show up first. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The HBO series normally debuts every new season in April, but season seven will likely launch later in 2017, as showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss revealed in a podcast interview with UFC Unfiltered: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We’re starting a bit later because at the end of this season, ‘Winter is here’ - and that means that sunny weather doesn’t really serve our purposes any more. So we kind of pushed everything down the line, so we could get some grim grey weather even in the sunnier places that we shoot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This implies we’ll see some of our more traditionally sunny lands of Westeros in entirely new ways. We’re used to the chilly environments of Winterfell and the Wall, but imagine seeing King’s Landing or Highgarden covered in clouds, rain, or even snow. And where are the people of Dorne supposed to go, since their entire kingdom seems to be made of nothing but porches and patios? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Game of Thrones is looking to have just two more shortened seasons before the series ends. The good news is that even if these final two seasons begin later that usual, they could still end in June, as per usual. It all depends on when, exactly, winter is coming ... in the real world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Digital Spy]","The wait for the next season of Game of Thrones just got a bit longer because, as io9 reports, winter isn't coming. At least not yet. New seasons of Game of Thrones typically debut in April, but weather in the European locations where the show films could push that back, the Verge reports. “We’re starting a bit later because at the end of this season ‘winter is here’—and that means that sunny weather doesn’t really serve our purposes any more,"" Thrones creators Dan Weiss and David Benioff say on the UFC Unfiltered podcast.

"In his address to the nation almost two weeks ago, President Obama promised to use force against the armies of Islamic State ""wherever they are,"" and he specifically mentioned Syria. But Monday night's airstrikes in that country came sooner and with more force than expected, targeting not only Islamic State but also the Khorasan Group, an Al Qaeda offshoot thought to be plotting attacks on Americans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This major offensive raises questions about whether the United States (and a few Arab allies) are planning a prolonged air campaign in a country whose leadership did not invite intervention. Coupled with his successful lobbying of Congress to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to train supposedly moderate Syrian rebels, the airstrikes mark a major reversal for Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until recently he has assiduously resisted American entanglement in Syria's civil war, and for good reason. The conflict pits President Bashar Assad, a secular dictator with innocent blood on his hands, against an assortment of opponents whose division into moderate and extremist factions isn't nearly so neat or stable as some advocates of U.S. intervention suppose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama changed his mind about intervention in Syria for the same reason he decided to launch airstrikes in Iraq and augment the U.S. military presence in that country: a sickeningly swift sequence of events in which Islamic State fighters routed Iraqi forces, terrorized Christians and other minorities and seemed poised to attack Baghdad. Obama also was influenced, understandably, by the horrific beheadings of two American journalists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The result was his promise of a long-term campaign to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" Islamic State. Obama said that wouldn't require U.S. combat forces. But if the threat posed by Islamic State justifies a rethinking of Obama's aversion to intervention in Syria, might it not also incline him to change his view about ""no boots on the ground""? Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that if necessary he would recommend that U.S. military ""advisors"" accompany Iraqi troops into battle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The airstrikes mark a major reversal for Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We find that prospect troubling. Islamic State is a heinous group, a threat to U.S. interests (though not, as far as we know, to the U.S. homeland) and a threat to the rights of those in the Middle East whom it despises as infidels. But is the threat serious enough to justify an ever-escalating role for the U.S. military in Syria and Iraq? Does the U.S. have a clear strategy and achievable aims? The case has yet to be made. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion  The initial bombing raids on Islamic State targets in Syria Monday night mark a welcome offensive that takes the war to the terrorists who beheaded two Americans and threaten U.S. interests in the Middle East and security at home. President Obama says this will be a long campaign, and it will need to be given the limitations he has put on the military. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The immediate impetus for the first air strikes was to stop ISIS assaults on Kurdish civilians in the north of Syria while also hitting the Khorasan branch of al Qaeda that...","The New York Times editorial board thinks President Obama has the US blundering into a new war with the expanded airstrikes in Syria. Before the US gets any deeper into the operation, the president should open this up for a full debate in Congress, says the editorial. It's also ""puzzling"" that in preparing the nation on Sept. 10 for these airstrikes, Obama said nothing about the Khorasan group that is suddenly Public Enemy No. 1. ""There isn’t a full picture—because Mr. Obama has not provided one—of how this bombing campaign will degrade the extremist groups without unleashing unforeseen consequences in a violent and volatile region,"" says the editorial. ""In the absence of public understanding or discussion and a coherent plan, the strikes in Syria were a bad decision."" Agree: The airstrikes are a ""major reversal"" for a president who opposed intervention in Syria for so long, writes the Los Angeles Times in an editorial. Can we trust that he won't reverse himself on ground troops, too? Yes, ISIS and the Khorasan group pose threats to US interests, ""but is the threat serious enough to justify an ever-escalating role for the US military in Syria and Iraq?"" asks the editorial. ""Does the US have a clear strategy and achievable aims? The case has yet to be made."" Disagree: The Wall Street Journal editorial board not only applauds the airstrikes but thinks US ground troops should be ready to move quickly. If the mission is to succeed, and it must, they'll be needed to direct airstrikes as militants hide in populated areas. ""No US President should ever start a war he doesn't intend to win, and wars rarely go as smoothly as advertised in advance,"" concludes the editorial. ""Now that he has attacked ISIS, Mr. Obama must show that America is the strong horse."""

"Most people know how to eat an artichoke: Using your teeth, you scrape the meat from the bottom of each leaf. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Miamian Arturo Carvajal, a doctor with a family practice in Hollywood and a litigant in one of the stranger lawsuits we've ever seen, was mystified by the vegetable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It takes a sophisticated diner to be familiar with the artichoke,"" says Carvajal's lawyer, Marc R. Ginsberg. ""People might think that, as a doctor, he'd know how to eat one. But he was thinking it was like a food he might have eaten in his native Cuba, where you eat everything on the plate."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In May 2009, Carvajal dined at Houston's in North Miami Beach. He order a grilled-artichoke special. It was a vegetable he had ""never seen nor heard of previously,"" Carvajal claims in court filings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The server ""fail[ed] to explain the proper method of consuming an artichoke,"" he says, namely that the ""outside portion of the leaf should not be eaten; rather, only the inside portion of the leaf was safely digestible."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anybody who's ever eaten an artichoke knows the outside leaves are tough, brittle, and nearly dagger-sharp. But apparently, Carvajal courageously gnawed his way through every leaf on his plate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can guess the rest of the story. Carvajal suffered ""severe abdominal pain and discomfort."" He went to the hospital, where an ""exploratory laparotomy"" revealed artichoke leaves lodged within his bowel, he claims.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This October 27, he filed a lawsuit alleging negligence seeking unspecified damages. We've embedded the complaint below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riptide called Hillstone Restaurant Group, which owns the Houston's chain, for comment but have not heard back yet.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to his Oct. 25 lawsuit filed in circuit court in Miami-Dade County against Hillstone Restaurant Group Inc., Arturo Carvajal said he was a customer in May 2009 when he was offered a house special of grilled artichokes, which was not on the menu. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Carvajal said he had neither seen nor heard of the dish previously, and his waiter never told him that the outside portion of the leaf is indigestible.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Glenn Viers, the restaurant chain's vp and general counsel, said while it is difficult to make light of a situation where a guest ends up in the hospital, “It's just kind of a silly notion” that the company has a duty to post warnings against someone eating an entire artichoke. “What's next? Are we going to have to post warnings on our menu they shouldn't eat the bones in our barbeque ribs?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Viers said also the firm will defend the lawsuit “vigorously.”","Just because Arturo Carvajal is a doctor, that doesn't mean he knows how to eat an artichoke—and he's suing a Miami restaurant for not instructing him on the proper method. Carvajal ordered the grilled artichoke (a vegetable he had ""never seen nor heard of previously,"" according to court filings) and proceeded to eat the entire thing, rather than scraping just the meat off of the leaves. He later found himself experiencing abdominal pain, and doctors found artichoke leaves lodged in his bowel. He filed a suit seeking unspecified damages last month, the Miami New Times reports. In it, he complains that the server failed ""to explain the proper method of consuming an artichoke."" His lawyer explains that Carvajal thought ""it was like a food he might have eaten in his native Cuba, where you eat everything on the plate.""

"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Scientists from the U.S. and Denmark are seeking to map out the plumbing system hidden inside the earth's crust that's responsible for the famous Old Faithful geyser and other hydrothermal features at Yellowstone National Park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Throughout November the research team will conduct flights over the park using a giant, hoop-shaped electromagnetic system suspended from a helicopter. The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but sometimes massive hydrothermal explosions that occur in the park, said lead scientist Carol Finn with the U.S. Geological Survey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One such explosion, or possibly multiple explosions, that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles (2.6 km) across beneath at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake. It's believed to be the largest such crater in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Similar to the regular eruptions of Old Faithful, hydrothermal explosions occur when huge pockets of boiling water beneath the ground experience a sudden drop in pressure, causing the water to convert to steam and explode violently to the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Similar work elsewhere in the U.S. has helped reveal hazards from volcanoes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Nobody knows anything about the flow paths"" for the hot water that erupts from Yellowstone's geysers, Finn said. ""Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The electromagnetic system was developed in Denmark to map out groundwater supplies in Denmark. It's able to discern between water and rocks to a depth of about 1,500 feet beneath the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Yellowstone, a better understanding of the hydrothermal plumbing could help administrators plot out future development so tourists can enjoy the park's features without damaging them or being put into harm's way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study is a collaboration between the U.S.G.S., Yellowstone National Park, the University of Wyoming and Denmark's Aarhus University.  This week, a survey will begin to map the underground hydrothermal features of Yellowstone National Park for the first time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the Aarhus University in Denmark and the University of Wyoming, will use a helicopter carrying electromagnetic technology that resembles a giant hula hoop to record tiny voltage signals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The data will be able to tell the scientists if they are flying over solid earth, “rotten” sulfuric rock, or water. Carol Finn, one of the scientists on the surveying team, said she has been looking forward to this for ten years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is really kind of a last frontier if you will, in Yellowstone, of being able to look at a large part that’s underground that people that people have not looked at,” said Finn. “This survey can visualize the geology and the water down to about 500 meters, so 1500 feet.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The goal of the project is to fill in the gaps of knowledge about what causes geysers like Old Faithful and hydrothermal explosions by locating where all that heated water flows underground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s just a lot we don’t know and this survey is really exciting because it’s going to be the first view of a large portion of the groundwater system, of the water underground that feeds all of these thermal features,” said Finn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The survey will also provide information that could help the park in the future by locating unstable ground. The researchers will fly the helicopter along the Mammoth-Norris corridor and take at least four weeks to complete.","The mysteries of Old Faithful may soon be solved, thanks, in part, to something that looks like a giant hula hoop. American and Danish scientists have this week begun an aerial survey of Yellowstone that actually looks well into the earth, ""visualizing"" the geology and water as much as 1,500 feet below the surface, says Carol Finn. She's waited a decade to explore what she calls ""a last frontier ... in Yellowstone,"" and the intention is to better map the flow of water that's feeding Old Faithful and rare but sometimes violent hydrothermal explosions. Over a four-week period, a helicopter will fly above, armed with electromagnetic technology that looks like a giant hula hoop. The AP explains it in layman's terms: ""The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface."" Scientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth, ""rotten"" sulfuric rock, or water lurks below, which could assist in identifying unstable areas, per Wyoming Public Media. But a press release frames the main quest like so: We know that the water that explodes from Yellowstone's geysers ""originates as old precipitation, snow and rain that percolates down into the crust, is heated, and ultimately returns to the surface."" We know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. ""Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?"" asks Finn. Right now, ""nobody knows."" (Archaeologists made a surprise find underneath a Mayan temple.)"
"Will we have the first American sitcom with openly HIV-positive star? Charlie Sheen, who yesterday publicly acknowledged his condition following a National Enquirer report, had been looking to topline another primetime comedy series. In the weeks leading to the admission, Sheen had been actively meeting with producers about developing a new half-hour starring vehicle for him. I hear among those Sheen reached out to and had meetings with were CBS TV Studios-based Eric Tannenbaum, who executive produced Sheen’s hugely successful CBS sitcom Two And A Half Men as well as executives from Sony Pictures TV. I hear nothing came out of the sit-downs, and there is no Sheen series set up at the moment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the Today interview yesterday, Sheen indicated that he has major projects in the hopper, including several features, and was confident that his HIV-positive status will not have an impact on his career. He pointed to his talks at Sony TV, noting that chairman Steve Mosko was “excited about doing a show again” with him. “Thus far, there’s been no resistance,” Sheen said. It is yet to be seen whether any potential lawsuits by sexual partners from the four years he had kept his condition a secret would change that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheen had been HIV-positive during the entire run of his previous sitcom, Anger Management. According to his own account, he was diagnosed in 2011, around the time he was pitching the project. It is unclear whether the actor revealed his condition to Lionsgate TV/Debmar-Mercury, which signed on to produce the show, and FX, which picked it up to series. Sources indicate that many if not all cast and crew members on the show were not aware Sheen was HIV-positive, at least not in the beginning. According to tabloid reports, Sheen’s colleagues became suspicious when production was shut down multiple times over the star’s health problems. A leaked email from the Sony hack indicates that top Sony TV executives and likely other industry types outside the studio were aware of the actor’s condition by early 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, despite his 2011 public meltdown that led to his firing from 2.5 Men and heavy drug and alcohol abuse to which Sheen has confessed, most recently in the Today interview, he was able to complete 100 episodes of Anger Management in 2.5 years and is looking for a follow-up series. That would be his fourth sitcom, following Spin City, 2.5 Men and Anger Management.  NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charlie Sheen on “Anger Management.” (Greg Gayne/FX) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apparently lost in the massive Sony e-mail hack that wreaked havoc on Hollywood last winter: this e-mail sent to several Sony Pictures Television executives in March 2014: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think I will win the 90/10 bet on the over under on this … it’s hard to to be a drug addict and be HIV positive and do 40 eps a year.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Included was a link to a TV Week article about how Charlie Sheen was a no-show on the set of his FX series “Anger Management,” and crew members were so frustrated they were threatening to quit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hacked e-mail amounts to a tasteless joke by an executive, saying that he didn’t expect Sheen to reach the 100-episode mark that would send “Anger Management” into syndication (and create a lucrative windfall for all involved). The 90/10 refers to the “Anger Management” deal that said if 10 episodes did well in the ratings, FX would pick up 90 more. As a reminder, Sheen landed the series, which aired from June 2012 to December 2014, after he imploded and was fired from CBS’s “Two and a Half Men.” The conventional wisdom at the time was that Sheen, known for erratic behavior, would be able to hold it together for 100 “Anger Management” episodes shot in just a couple years. (The show filmed exactly 100 episodes.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Charlie Sheen says he’s HIV-positive, has been extorted for $10 million over diagnosis] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The e-mail indicates that Sheen’s HIV diagnosis was no secret to some in the entertainment industry. And while Sheen’s announcement that he is HIV-positive (and his claims that he spent $10 million trying to keep it quiet) was a huge story this week, a passing reference to the news was out there for two years for anyone to see, be it publications that initially pored over the documents or anyone who dug into the Wikileaks Sony hack page. And yet the story was never revealed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This bit of information gives some context to what Sheen and Matt Lauer talked about when discussing his future career prospects at the end of his “Today” show interview. Sheen’s confident attitude makes sense given that his diagnosis was already known in certain circles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Let me ask you about working and your career,” Lauer said. “You had a show canceled a couple years ago. You are, I imagine in need of working again … how do you think this revelation might impact your status or standing in Hollywood?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As we speak, I have the chairman of Sony excited about doing a show again,” Sheen said. “I have a couple of films lined up that I could, you know, put start dates on. There’s a lot of people that we’ve even told that I’m going to do this [interview] before I came on — privately, of course — and they said, ‘Well, of course… he’s still the best guy for the job.’ ” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And so thus far,” Sheen concluded, “there’s been no resistance.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read more: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charlie Sheen’s porn star ex is furious after HIV reveal: ‘He never said anything to me.’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jon Cryer is brutally blunt describing the worst Charlie Sheen years on ‘Two and a Half Men’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Two and a Half Men’ finally gets revenge on Charlie Sheen with insult-filled series finale","Charlie Sheen's HIV diagnosis was joked about in an email exposed, but never publicized, during last year's Sony hack, the Washington Post reports. The email from a Sony exec was joking about the fact that Sheen wasn't showing up to work on Anger Management, his FX series. ""I think I will win the 90/10 bet on the over under on this … it's hard to to be a drug addict and be HIV positive and do 40 eps a year,"" the email reads. It's always been available on the Wikileaks Sony hack page, but hadn't been released to the larger public until now. The email was referring to a deal that stated if 10 episodes performed well, FX would order 90 more; the series, which premiered in June 2012 and ended in December 2014, was supposed to film 100 episodes in two years, enough to send it into syndication—and it did end up filming exactly that many. As the Post notes, the email illustrates the fact that some in the industry were very much aware of Sheen's diagnosis before he revealed it publicly. Deadline notes that Sheen is currently looking to do another TV series."

"(CNN) Idaho State University has been fined after it lost track of a small amount of plutonium 239, a substance used to make nuclear weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University Officials say the sample, missing since 2003, does not pose a direct health issue or risk to public safety. The substance had been used by the school to conduct several research experiments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The school realized it had lost track of the plutonium earlier this year and immediately notified the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ISU officials said the sample, weighing a gram, was lost as it was being taken out of service after employees only partially filled out the necessary paperwork.

A small amount of radioactive, weapons-grade plutonium about the size of a U.S. quarter... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A small amount of radioactive, weapons-grade plutonium about the size of a U.S. quarter is missing from an Idaho university that was using it for research, leading federal officials on Friday to propose an $8,500 fine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Idaho State University can't account for about a 30th of an ounce (1 gram) of the material that's used in nuclear reactors and to make nuclear bombs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The amount is too small to make a nuclear bomb, agency spokesman Victor Dricks said, but could be used to make a dirty bomb to spread radioactive contamination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The NRC has very rigorous controls for the use and storage of radioactive materials as evidenced by this enforcement action,"" he said of the proposed fine for failing to keep track of the material. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,"" he said in a statement to The Associated Press. ""The radioactive source in question poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Idaho State University has a nuclear engineering program and works with the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory, considered the nation's primary nuclear research lab and located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of the school. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plutonium was being used to develop ways to ensure nuclear waste containers weren't leaking and to find ways to detect radioactive material being illegally brought into the U.S. following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the school said in an email to the AP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency said a school employee doing a routine inventory discovered the university could only account for 13 of its 14 plutonium sources, each weighing about the same small amount. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The school searched documents and found records from 2003 and 2004 saying the material was on campus and awaiting disposal. However, there were no documents saying the plutonium had been properly disposed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The last document mentioning the plutonium is dated Nov. 23, 2003. It said the Idaho National Laboratory didn't want the plutonium and the school's technical safety office had it ""pending disposal of the next waste shipment."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The school also reviewed documents on waste barrels there and others transferred off campus since 2003, and opened and examined some of them. Finally, officials searched the campus but didn't find the plutonium. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nuclear commission said senior university officials planned to return the school's remaining plutonium to the Energy Department. It's not clear if that has happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Energy Department officials didn't return calls seeking comment Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dricks, the commission spokesman, said returning the plutonium was part of the school's plan to reduce its inventory of radioactive material. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said overall it has ""a good record with the NRC."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This story has been corrected to show that the missing plutonium is about a 30th of an ounce, not a third of an ounce.","A university has admitted to misplacing a gram of weapons-grade plutonium, and federal authorities want to fine them $8,500. Per CNN, Idaho State University has not been able to account for the bit of radioactive material since 2003 but, nonetheless, believes it was properly stored at a licensed disposal facility. However, with no documented proof, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday it must propose the fine. Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. ""Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,"" he said in a statement to the AP.

The plutonium was being used to develop ways to ensure nuclear waste containers weren't leaking and to find ways to detect radioactive material being illegally brought into the US following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While the missing amount could not be used to make a nuclear bomb, it could be used to create a so-called dirty bomb to spread nuclear contamination. The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The three were locked down together in a single cell around 2 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) when one started screaming, saying another of them was very sick, Choctaw County Sheriff Tom Abate said. The jailer looked through a porthole, saw someone vomiting, then opened the cell door. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he did, the inmates jumped the jailer, stole his keys and cell phone, then fled on foot, according to Abate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local authorities using tracking dogs tracked the escaped inmates about one-quarter mile away down State Highway 17 in Butler, Alabama, where Abate said they were either picked up or had a vehicle waiting for them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two escapees who were being held on capital murder charges, for separate incidents, are 23-year-old Demarcus Woodward for allegedly fatally shooting a work release inmate and 32-year-old Gemayel Culbert for his involvement in the killing of two people at a private club in northern Choctaw County. The other escapee is Terrell Gordon, 23, who is charged with armed robbery in connection with a convenience store theft. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alabama's state Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Marshals from Mobile and local authorities all have roles in the manhunt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The jailer who these inmates allegedly choked was treated and released at an area hospital, Abate said Saturday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Choctaw County, with population of fewer than 14,000, is in southwestern Alabama, bordering Mississippi.","The search is on in Alabama after two men charged with murder and another charged with armed robbery escaped their shared prison cell. Prior to the escape, one of the three began shouting in the cell, saying a cellmate was ill, the Choctaw County sheriff says. A guard checked up on them to find that one was throwing up, CNN reports. He opened the cell door, and the men attacked him, grabbing his keys and cell phone, the sheriff says. The guard was hospitalized and released after allegedly being choked. Now, authorities are looking for Demarcus Woodard, 23, Gemayel Culbert, 32, and Justin Terrell Gordon, 23, the Choctaw Sun-Advocate reports. ""I've got three bad inmates, two capital murders and one armed robber, who are on foot,"" the sheriff tells AL.com. Dogs followed a trail to a highway near the prison, where officials think the men may have been picked up."
"TOKYO — A crucial stage in the decades-long job of decommissioning Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant began Tuesday, with operators starting to dismantle huge protective covers from one of the reactors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station suffered meltdowns in three of its six reactors after a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the country in March 2011. The disaster killed around 16,000 people, forced some 300,000 to evacuate their homes, and left a huge area of land unusable for decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, installed six 136-foot covers over one of the reactors in October that year to stop radioactive materials escaping. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: Thousands of Fukushima Nuke Refugees to Be Allowed Home NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The operator began on Tuesday to remove the first of these covers, an essential stage before they can extract the 292 spent fuel rods inside. They hope to remove all the covers by the end of next year, and begin extracting the fuel rods in 2020.  TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan on Tuesday approved an increase in compensation payments for the Fukushima crisis to 7.07 trillion yen ($57.18 billion), as tens of thousands of evacuees remain in temporary housing more than four years after the disaster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), the operator of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear station, will receive 950 billion yen more in public funds on top of the 6.125 trillion agreed earlier, the utility and the government said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The increase, agreed after a request by Tepco, adds to the bill for taxpayers for the disaster in March 2011, when three reactors melted down after an earthquake and tsunami, in the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986, destroying businesses and livelihoods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tepco has face a stream of legal cases seeking compensation over the disaster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Electricity bills for Japanese households have also risen 25 percent since the catastrophe as the country resorted to importing more fossils fuels with the gradual shutdown of all nuclear reactors for safety checks and upgrades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government and Tepco, which was bailed out by taxpayers in 2012, are undertaking an unprecedented cleanup to lower radiation levels in towns closest to the plant, although some areas will likely remain off limits for decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inside the plant, Tepco has struggled to bring the situation under control and it is estimated removing the melted fuel from the wrecked reactors and cleaning up the site will cost tens of billions of dollars and take decades to complete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government plans to revoke evacuation orders for most people forced from their homes by the disaster within two years as part of a plan to cap compensation payouts and speed up reconstruction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Aaron Sheldrick and Ed Davies)  This video shows various measures against dust dispersion during the dismantling work of cover panels over Unit 1 reactor building. At Unit 1, rubble from the damaged building caused by the hydrogen explosion is still scattered and needs to be removed. Cover panels were placed over the rubble to prevent the dispersion of radioactive materials, but dismantling of the panels started in July 2015 to remove the rubble. Wall pannels will be taken down around September 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watch the video here","It's going to take decades to completely decommission the Fukushima nuclear power plant, but a critical step in that process began in earnest today, reports NBC News. One of the six 136-foot covers draped over one of the plant's nuclear reactors to keep radioactive materials from seeping out is being painstakingly removed. Tepco officials say it will take till the end of 2016 to pry all six covers off, and till at least 2020 to remove the nearly 300 spent fuel rods lurking underneath. The project, which was supposed to commence last July, was previously postponed because of fears of radiation escaping. ""For the safety of Fukushima's residents, we would like the work to proceed with extra care,"" says the chief of a group of monitors overseeing the project. The total cost and time for the entire decommissioning assignment: tens of billions of dollars over 30 years or so, NBC notes. Meanwhile, the Japanese government today approved an increase in compensation payments to Tepco to a total of $57.2 billion, Reuters reports. That's $7.7 billion added onto the $49.5 billion in taxpayer-funded aid that Tepco had previously been approved to receive.

"The legal team leading the prosecution of former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has gone on the offensive in enlisting a prominent French lawyer, Thibault de Montbrial, to locate any of Strauss-Kahn's alleged past victims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the last several weeks, France has stood by watching as one of its most prominent international figures, fallen IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has been processed by the US justice system following his arrest on sexual assault charges. But now, one of France's own will be jumping into the legal fray unfolding on the other side of the Atlantic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team of New York lawyers representing the 32-year-old Guinean hotel maid who accused Strauss-Kahn of sexually assaulting her have asked Paris-based lawyer Thibault de Montbrial to help dig up previous victims of the French politician, news reports on Thursday stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 42-year-old Montbrial, described in the French press as an avid athlete who loves football and combat sports, is not considered “one of the star criminal lawyers in France”, according to French daily Le Monde’s legal correspondent Pascale Robert Diard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, he is “very respected and has worked on some of the big French political and financial cases”, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those cases include the infamous Clearstream trial – Montbrial served as lawyer for accused former EADS head Jean-Louis Gergorin – and the defence of Renault executive Matthieu Tenenbaum, accused of spying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Montbrial has also played a prominent role in certain international cases, representing the families of victims of the Karachi bombings and victims of former Tunisian President Ben Ali’s regime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Pascale Robert Diard, Montbrial is not, however, known for working on cases involving rape or sexual assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hunt for witnesses or ‘communications operation’? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Montbrial, contacted by France 24 on Friday, declined to comment. But a day earlier, he told Reuters that he was chosen, because the legal team representing Strauss-Kahn’s accuser, led by Kenneth Thompson and Douglas Wigdor, were “looking for an attorney in France who had a certain amount of visibility and independence in France, where this is a very complicated case”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to reports, several high-profile French lawyers had been short-listed by New York legal team of Strauss-Kahn’s accuser, with proficiency in English among the criteria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thompson and Wigdor, the accuser’s main lawyers, cannot directly intervene in the criminal trial of Dominique Strauss-Kahn – which officially pits Strauss-Kahn against the people of the state of New York – but they can collaborate with prosecutors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In early June, Thompson appeared on French TV, calling for other women to come forward if they, too, had been attacked by Strauss-Kahn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are two possible motivations behind a publicised search for former victims of any possible sexual misconduct by Strauss-Kahn, Pascale Robert Diard explained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Either they really think they can find women to testify against [Strauss-Kahn], or it’s a big communications operation intended to show the other side that those leading the case against Strauss-Kahn are on the offensive,” she assessed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s defence team has, in turn, explicitly asked the prosecution if they intend to talk about past claims of unwanted sexual advances by their client when the trial opens; the prosecution has not yet responded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strauss-Kahn remains under house arrest in New York City and has pleaded not guilty to the charges of attempted rape, sex abuse, a criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. If he is convicted, he could serve up to 25 years in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Date created : 2011-06-24  The 32-year-old maid has added Thibault de Montbrial to her legal team, the French attorney told Reuters, after he was contacted by her New York-based lawyer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I was hired to see if we can contact other victims of Strauss-Kahn ,"" de Montbrial said in a telephone interview. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""They (the U.S. lawyers) were looking for an attorney in France who had a certain amount of visibility and independence in France, where this is a very complicated case,"" de Montbrial said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strauss-Kahn, 62, was arrested on board an Air France flight to Paris just minutes before it was due to depart New York's John F. Kennedy Airport on May 14. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is under house arrest in New York City and has pleaded not guilty to attempted rape, sex abuse, a criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His lead defence attorney, Benjamin Brafman, declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The maid hired a legal team to defend against allegations by Strauss-Kahn's lawyers that she consented to having sex in the hotel room, and to help prosecutors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this month, the maid's New York-based lawyer Kenneth Thompson appealed on French television for other women with claims against Strauss-Kahn to come forward.","The hotel maid accusing Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexual assault has hired a well-known lawyer in France to look for other women who may have fallen prey to the banker, the Telegraph reports. “I was hired to see if we can contact other victims,” Thibault de Montbrial says, explaining that the maid’s US team wanted someone “who had a certain amount of visibility and independence in France, where this is a very complicated case.” The maid’s New York-based lawyer has already appeared on French television once to call for other victims to come forward. Her attorneys can’t directly get involved with the criminal case against the banker, but can help the prosecution. One French legal expert tells France 24 that the move could be a legitimate search for witnesses or “a big communications operation” to show her team is on the offensive."

That Good Samaritan, Michael Long, also has a metal detector, and so when he heard about the lost ring, he ""thought it would just be nice to get up there, help a random couple out, and find the ring before someone else found it."" Long says it took him hours, spread out over two days, to find the ring in Loose Park Pond, pulling up a couple dozen nails and a toy car before he unearthed what he was looking for on Saturday. Per the Kansas City Star, the ring had already been found when Dixon and Salas appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday, where they re-created the ill-fated proposal, then accepted a brand-new diamond ring from Kimmel to replace their lost one. (Long says he got in touch with Dixon in California on Monday.) Dixon said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that they alerted Kimmel's staff about Long's discovery once they found out about it—he noted the ring was found while ""Ruth and I have been in Los Angeles""—and that ""we have been completely honest ... during this entire process."" He also notes Kimmel and Co. still insisted they keep the ring. ""Now for the next adventure to get married on October 21, 2017!!!!"" Dixon wrote."
"Crawls performed by Internet Archive on behalf of the National Library of Australia. This data is currently not publicly accessible.  Most psychologists agree that a person's basic personality—whether they are an introvert or extrovert, for example—remains the same throughout life. What we might see as personality changes are actually just responses to external factors, such as getting a job, getting married or becoming a parent. That said, research does indicate that our personalities become more solidified, or stable, as we get older. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That change is not linear, however. New research indicates that our personalities become increasingly stable as our 20s melt into our 30s, 40s and even 50s, but that that stability then often begins to taper off in old age, Research Digest reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers in New Zealand recruited 4,000 men and women aged 20 to 80 to complete a personality questionnaire twice, with a gap of two years in between. The survey measured a person's honesty-humility factor as well as five major personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience, Research Digest writes. They compared how people's scores varied between years, and analyzed how all of the participants personalities related to one another, depending on age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most people's personalities were generally stable, they found, but the stability of those trait followed a bell curve over time, peaking at middle-age and then dropping again. For certain traits—conscientiousness, openness to experience, and honesty-humility—Research Digest writes, the oldest participants' personality stability matched those of the youngest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other interesting finds included ""domain specific"" variations, or ones that seem to be linked to what a person is dealing with at a particular point in their life. People in their 30s, for example, showed high levels of neuroticism, but by the time they reached their 50s that had tapered off and had been replaced by conscientiousness, openness and honesty-humility.","There's no doubt about it: The human body goes through major changes in youth and old age. And these biological and social changes may be the reasons behind what researchers are calling less stable personalities at those life stages. In fact, according to a study of almost 4,000 New Zealanders between the ages of 20 and 80, the stability of one's personality increases through youth and into middle age and peaks in our 50s, before we slide back into less stable versions of ourselves, reports Research Digest. As the Smithsonian puts it, ""in some ways, our 80-year-old selves mirror our 20-year-old selves."" Some traits peaked at different times; the most stable traits in one's 30s are extraversion and neuroticism, while in the late 40s and early 50s it is openness, honesty-humility, and conscientiousness. The only trait that showed ""gradually reduced stability"" throughout life was agreeableness; apparently we are simply less and less agreeable as we pack the years on. Still, one's most basic personality—introvert vs. extrovert, for example—tends to remain consistent throughout one's life, even if the stability of traits waxes and wanes, notes the Smithsonian. (Other researchers have even calculated the country's most extroverted city.)"

"His attorney argued Murray should remain free until sentencing, noting he had family obligations. ""There is no reason to remand him under these circumstances,"" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Pastor was giving his order, a bailiff handcuffed Murray behind his back while he was sitting in his seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is not a crime involving a mistake of judgment,” Pastor said. “This is a crime where the end result was the death of a human being. That factor demonstrates rather dramatically that the public should be protected.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A judge on Monday ordered Dr. Conrad Murray to jail, just a few minutes after a jury found him guilty in the death of Michael Jackson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murray, Michael Jackson's personal physician, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for causing the pop icon's 2009 death by a powerful surgical anesthetic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The verdict against Dr. Conrad Murray comes after a jury of seven men and five women deliberated for about nine hours over two days. The 58-year-old cardiologist, who was charged with the lowest possible homicide offense, faces a maximum sentence of four years in state prison and a minimum sentence of probation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murray now also faces the probable loss of his medical license. California authorities already suspended his right to practice, but medical boards in Nevada and Texas agreed to wait to evaluate licenses he holds in their states until after the criminal case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over four weeks, prosecutors painted Murray as a deceptive and incompetent doctor who abandoned his medical judgment in complying with Jackson's request to be given a surgical anesthetic to put him to sleep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses testified to many egregious medical missteps -– giving propofol in an unmonitored setting, fumbling at basic resuscitation, keeping no records –- failures that experts said directly led to Jackson's overdose death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As his famed patient stopped breathing and suffered cardiac arrest under the influence of propofol, jurors were told, the doctor chatted on the phone and sent and received emails and text messages. And in the crucial moments after he discovered the singer had stopped breathing, he delayed calling for help and lied to paramedics and emergency doctors, witnesses said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Central to the government's case were the doctor's own words from a police interview two days after Jackson's death. In the 2-1/2-hour tape, Murray admitted to giving the singer the propofol -– caving in after Jackson repeatedly begged for it, he said -– as well as two other drugs earlier in the day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Admissions in the interview were enough evidence of the doctor's guilt, witnesses said. But the prosecution's star witness also said levels of the drug found during an autopsy showed Murray lied about how much propofol he administered. Dr. Steven Shafer, a renowned anesthesiologist and propofol expert, said the only plausible scenario was that Murray left a large drip of the anesthetic running into Jackson's blood after he was dead.

One bit of good news for Murray: Jail officers will consider him a ""keep away inmate"" in an effort to protect him behind bars, TMZ reports. In other words, Murray will get his own cell, shower alone, and won't be allowed to mingle with other prisoners. The doctor's lonely spell will be broken on November 29 for sentencing.

Abstract NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pole vaulting is a unique sport in that athletes often land from heights ranging from 10 to 20 feet. We retrospectively reviewed 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms of injury so that preventive strategies can be implemented. Information was obtained by means of a telephone interview with someone familiar with the accident. All injuries occurred in male athletes at an average age of 17.5 years; 31 were catastrophic head injuries and 1 was a thoracic spine fracture that resulted in paraplegia. Three common mechanisms were identified: 17 (53%) athletes landed with their body on the landing pad and their head on the surrounding hard ground, 8 (25%) landed in the vault box after being stranded at the height of the jump, and 5 (16%) completely missed the landing pad. The mechanism of injury in the remaining two athletes was unknown. The accident resulted in death in 16 (50%) athletes and in permanent disability in 6 (19%). Increasing the minimum landing pad size and enforcing the rule requiring soft surfaces adjacent to the landing pads are the primary recommendations for preventing injuries. The authors discuss other rule and equipment changes that may help reduce the occurrence of future injuries.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of collegiate athletes participating in pole vault over a single track-and-field season. Baseline athlete information was collected on study enrollment. Injuries were recorded in a standardized form to document diagnosis and event circumstances. A log of practice and competition exposures was maintained for each athlete. Injury incidence was reported as the proportion of injured vaulters and number of new injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures. Regression analysis on baseline variables was performed to determine risks for injury. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results: A total of 135 vaulters from 15 universities took part in the study. There were 70 injury events reported during 8823 exposures. Forty-one percent of vaulters sustained injury, and there were 7.9 injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures. The low back was the most common injury location (16.7%), followed by the hamstrings and lower leg (13.9% each). Overall, 60% of injuries were to the lower extremities, 21% to the upper extremities, and 18% to the back. No head or neck injuries were reported. Injuries were most commonly muscular strains (39.2%) or overuse type (25.5%). Thirty percent, including 83% of low back injuries, occurred during the plant/takeoff phase of the vault. One-third of lumbar injuries were spondylolysis, with 75% of these being season ending. The odds of injury were 2.7 (95% CI, 1.1-7.1) times greater in vaulters with multiple prior injuries.","If the words ""pole vaulting"" don't inspire fear in you, they should. That's the upshot of a Vice article about the sport, which succinctly expresses why: ""At 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands."" If that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: A 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that ""injuries are very common in experienced vaulters."" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as ""risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose."" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast. Walker says you need ""significant body control and spatial awareness,"" too."

"JORGE Mario Bergoglio, the man this week elected as the first Latin American pope, reportedly turned to religion after he was spurned by his childhood sweetheart when they were both just 12 years old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to 76-year-old Amalia Damonte, Pope Francis once declared ""If I can't marry you, I'll become a priest"" after she rejected him during their childhood in Buenos Aires. ""Luckily for him, I said no"", she joked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking from her home, four doors down from where Francis grew up in Flores, Argentina, Damonte revealed her parents had kept the two apart because they disapproved of their budding romance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""When we were young, he wrote me a letter and I didn't reply to him,"" she told the Argentinean press. ""My father had hit me because I had dared to write a note to a boy."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damonte's revelation came as the sister of the 266th pontiff, María Elena Bergoglio, said she was concerned her brother would face ""infinite loneliness"" in his new role. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She told the Daily Telegraph Francis had jokingly said ""no, please no"" at the prospect of being the next Pope. ""I didn't want him to become Pope because he's going to be very far away and second because it is such a large responsibility. But I am also totally proud that he is the new Pope - because he's the first from outside Europe, because he's Latin American, he's Argentine and he's my brother,"" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite his apparent reluctance, Francis, 76, was elected the Catholic Church's leader on Wednesday, replacing 85-year-old Benedict, who stepped down last month. Bergoglio inherits a church wrestling with an array of challenges that intensified during Pope Benedict's tenure - from growing competition from evangelical churches in the Southern Hemisphere to a priest shortage and a sexual abuse crisis. ·","Apparently you can credit Amalia Damonte for Jorge Bergoglio becoming Pope Francis—or perhaps her father, reports the Week. When Bergoglio was just 12, he had a young ""romance"" with Damonte, writing a letter saying they would be married and drawing a picture of the house they would live in. She said he vowed to become a priest if Amalia, who lived near him in a Buenos Aires suburb, rejected the offer. However, Damonte's father wasn't about to stand for his 12-year-old daughter talking to boys, and slapped her for starting to write back. ""I never saw him after that—my parents kept me away from him and did everything possible to separate us,"" says Damonte, adding that ""it was a thing between children and totally pure."" The Telegraph, meanwhile, catches up with the pope's sister, Maria Elena Bergoglio, who says her brother was never jazzed about the prospect of leading the church. ""He didn't want to be pope and when we chatted privately about it, we joked at the prospect and he would say, 'No, please no.'"""
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is mounting a serious effort to challenge U.S. military superiority in air and space, forcing the Pentagon to seek new technologies and systems to stay ahead of its rapidly developing rival, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work said on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pentagon’s chief operating officer, speaking to a group of military and civilian aerospace experts, said China was “quickly closing the technological gaps,” developing radar-evading aircraft, advanced reconnaissance planes, sophisticated missiles and top-notch electronic warfare equipment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While hoping for a constructive relationship with China, the Pentagon “cannot overlook the competitive aspects of our relationship, especially in the realm of military capabilities, an area in which China continues to improve at a very impressive rate,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China’s state-run news agency Xinhua late on Monday cited Xu Qiliang, a vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, as saying China must innovate even more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our military’s equipment construction is shifting from catch-up research to independent innovations,” Xu said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Work made his remarks to the inaugural conference of the China Aerospace Studies Initiative, a partnership of the U.S. Air Force and the RAND Corporation think tank. The initiative aims to boost U.S. research on China’s aerospace ambitions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The conference came as hundreds of Chinese officials were in Washington for the three-day U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, wide-ranging talks that look at areas of mutual cooperation and address points of friction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about the timing of the military conference, Work said U.S. and Chinese leaders both see the bilateral relationship as one in which there are “measures of cooperation and measures of competition.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re hoping over time that the cooperative aspects outweigh competitive aspects,” Work added. “As the Department of Defense, we’re the hedge force. ... We say, ‘Look, here are capabilities that we see that the Chinese are developing and it’s important for us to be able to counter those.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Work, citing a Harvard study on rising powers confronting established powers, told the conference that interactions between the two often result in war. As a result, the Defense Department must “hedge against this international competition turning more heated.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States has generally felt the best hedge is a strong nuclear and conventional deterrence capable of overmatching any rival, he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Work said the United States has relied on technological superiority for the past 25 years, but now “the margin of technological superiority upon which we have become so accustomed ... is steadily eroding.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To adjust, he said, the Pentagon is working to develop new technologies to maintain its edge and lower the cost of responding to attacks. Directed energy weapons, for example, might be able to shoot down missiles that cost a hundred times the price of a jolt of energy.  BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese military leader has called for accelerated innovation and development of the country's national defense technology. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Xu Qiliang, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks during an inspection in east China's Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""China is in a crucial transition from 'big' to 'strong,' and our military's equipment construction is shifting from catch-up research to independent innovations,"" Xu was quoted in a statement made public Monday as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Xu, priorities should be given to research in both basic and cutting-edge fields, and research achievements must be transformed into advanced production and combat abilities in a timely fashion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The whole of the society should be encouraged to take part in the innovation cause for national defense technologies,"" Xu said, urging integrated support of technology, talents and funds as the foundation for better innovation efficiency.","The Pentagon is digging deeper in its push for new air and space technologies as China threatens to unseat the US as king of the skies. Speaking with aerospace experts at the China Aerospace Studies Initiative, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work says the US' rival is ""quickly closing the technological gaps,"" per Reuters. Specifically, China is developing highly advanced radar-evading aircraft, reconnaissance planes, missiles, and electronic warfare equipment, Work says, suggesting the US needs to step up its game. That’s becoming increasingly difficult, however, as ""the margin of technological superiority upon which we have become so accustomed ... is steadily eroding,"" Work says. ""As the Department of Defense, we're the hedge force,"" he says. ""We say, 'Look, here are capabilities that we see that the Chinese are developing and it's important for us to be able to counter those.'"" Though he doesn’t exactly dive into what technologies the Pentagon is working on, he says one way we might do that is with directed energy weapons that can shoot down pricey missiles at a low cost. Interestingly, Work’s comments were quickly followed by a Xinhua report noting Chinese military officials are also boosting development of national defense technology. ""The whole of the society should be encouraged to take part in the innovation cause,"" a Chinese official is quoted as saying. (Tension with China is clear at sea as well as in the skies.)"
"Speaking at a conference in Sweden's third-largest city of Malmö, home to a large immigrant population, the Dalai Lama – who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 – said Europe was ""morally responsible"" for helping ""a refugee really facing danger against their life"". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Receive them, help them, educate them… but ultimately they should develop their own country,"" said the 83-year-old Tibetan who fled the capital Lhasa in fear of his life after China poured troops into the region to crush an uprising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I think Europe belongs to the Europeans,"" he said, adding they should make clear to refugees that ""they ultimately should rebuild their own country"". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Dalai Lama at the conference in Malmö. Photo: Johan Nilsson/TT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Revered by millions of Buddhists around the world, and regarded by his many supporters as a visionary in the vein of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, the Dalai Lama was speaking three days after the far-right populist party Sweden Democrats made gains in the country's general election on Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The anti-immigration party came in third, behind Prime Minister Stefan Löfven's Social Democrats and the opposition conservative Moderates in the Nordic nation which in 2015 took in the highest number of asylum seekers per capita in Europe.  The exiled spiritual leader of Tibet said Wednesday that, while Europe can help refugees, “Europe belongs to the Europeans” and migrants should rebuild their homelands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Dalai Lama made the comments at a conference in Malmo, Sweden, which has struggled with an increase in rape and violent crimes correlating to an increase in refugees from Syria and other predominantly Muslim countries. The Dalai Lama argued that European countries were “morally responsible” for assisting “a refugee really facing danger against their life,” but that refugees should ultimately go back and rebuild their home countries. (Pope’s ‘Don’t Close Your Doors’ Refugee Initiative Begins On The 445th Anniversary Of Papal Army Driving Out Islamic Invaders) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Receive them, help them, educate them … but ultimately they should develop their own country,” the Dalai Lama said, according to AFP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think Europe belongs to the Europeans,” he added, saying “they ultimately should rebuild their own country.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spiritual leader’s comments likely struck a chord with locals, as Sweden has experienced an explosion in violent migrant gang-related incidents, many of which involved military-grade explosive devices, since 2014 when over 100,000 asylum seekers from predominantly Muslim countries settled in the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Dalai Lama also made similar comments concerning refugees in Germany in 2016, saying that “Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Germany is Germany. There are so many that in practice it becomes difficult,” he said, according to Independent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “From a moral point of view, too, I think that the refugees should only be admitted temporarily,” he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Dalai Lama clarified at the time that he had compassion for refugees, especially those fleeing from war, but said now the goal of aid should be their return to their homelands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When we look into the face of every single refugee, especially the children and women, we can feel their suffering,” he said. “The goal should be that they return and help rebuild their countries.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Dalai Lama has remained in exile since 1959, when he escaped Tibet and settled in India with tens of thousands of followers after Chinese communist troops took over the region. The Indian government agreed to grant asylum to him and his followers and also granted voting rights to Tibetans born in India. The Indian government also bore all expenses related to establishing schools for Tibetan children in the country.

"“Tonight, we tucked our kids in bed and my husband and I enjoyed a glass of wine on the deck. We were talking about how excited we were to attend an upcoming wedding in Kalamazoo (where we met and went to college) and discussing what would be the perfect gift for the newlyweds. So, I thought back to our wedding day (nearly 9 years ago) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me. The funny thing? The gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closet… unopened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On our wedding day, my husband Brandon and I received a gift from my Great Aunt Alison. On the plain white box was a card that read, “Do not open until your 1st disagreement.” Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years. There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up… but we never opened the box. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure. To us, it would have meant that we didn’t have what it takes to make our marriage work – and we’re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations. Was it really time to open the box? What if this isn’t our worst fight? What if there’s a worse one ahead of us and we don’t have our box?!? As my Great Uncle Bill would say, ‘Nothing is ever so bad that it couldn’t get worse.’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage – an age old trick – unbeknownst to us rookies. After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save “us” – and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience.

I realized that the tools for creating and maintaining a strong, healthy marriage were never within that box – they were within us.”  KALAMAZOO, Mich., Sept. 7 (UPI) -- A former Michigan couple who received a wedding gift that instructed them not to open it until their ""first disagreement"" said they finally opened it 9 years later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kathy Gunn said in a post on the Love What Matters Facebook group that she and her husband, Brandon, received a gift at their Kalamazoo, Mich., wedding from Kathy's Great Aunt Alison.

A British cafe has introduced the queen of all breakfasts, a 59-item spread that packs in 7,778 calories. The Corner Cafe's Monster Mega Breakfast comes across as slightly redundant: It contains eggs and omelets, fried potatoes (four portions) and hash browns, and both toast and fried bread. Plus bacon, sausages, mushrooms, chips, onion rings, black pudding, tomatoes, and beans. The meal costs about $22.50 and has a time limit attached: Those attempting to polish it off have an hour to do so if they want to win a place on the wall of champions, a breakfast coupon, and a key ring. They'll be helped (or hindered?) along the way with one of two drinks: their choice of a milkshake or energy drink, reports the Bristol Post. A manager of the Portishead cafe tells the Post that since being launched earlier this month, five people have ordered it and none have finished. Quirky side note: No one under 18 is allowed to order it. The cafe's Facebook page has photos of those who have made the attempt, along with a message to those who have accused it of being wasteful. Its post begins, ""We are just a little family run business who can't save the entire world from famine and starvation!"" Could the 8,000-calorie breakfast be the start of a trend?

"“The heist took about 3 minutes and 40 seconds,” Mr. Durham says in the documentary. “When I was done, the police were there, and I was passing by with my getaway car. Took my ski mask off, window down, and I was looking at them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He adds: “I could hear them on my police scanner. They didn’t know it was me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Durham, in details that he shares for the first time, after years of claiming innocence, brags of doing “bank jobs, safety deposit and more spectacular jobs than this.” He says he targeted the museum not because of any interest in art but simply because he could. “That’s the eye of a burglar,” he boasts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The works are of inestimable value because they have never been to market: “View of the Sea at Scheveningen” (1882) is one of only two seascapes van Gogh painted during his years in the Netherlands, and “Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen” (1882-84), showing the church where the artist’s father was a pastor, was a gift to the artist’s mother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Prices for van Gogh landscape paintings at auction range from about $10 million to about $70 million.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mr. Durham did not know the historical background of the paintings. He said the paintings were the smallest ones in the gallery he targeted, and closest to the hole through which he entered. He stuffed them into a bag, and escaped by sliding down a rope he and his accomplice had put in place. When he hit the ground, he came down so hard that he smashed the seascape, chipping the paint. He left behind a black baseball cap. A security guard called the police, but she was not permitted to use force to try to stop the burglars.  In 2002 pleegde beroepscrimineel Octave Durham een geruchtmakende schilderijenroof in het Van Gogh Museum. Hij stal twee unieke, kostbare doeken van Vincent van Gogh. Durham werd veroordeeld en moet nog altijd tonnen schadevergoeding betalen aan het museum. In deze documentaire legt hij voor het eerst een gedetailleerde bekentenis af en volgen we hem in zijn zoektocht naar de verdwenen schilderijen, die hij destijds verkocht aan de maffia. Om zijn schuld aan het museum af te kunnen lossen probeerde hij het afgelopen jaar de schilderijen terug te vinden. Maar tijdens zijn speurtocht werden de doeken plotseling door de Italiaanse politie ontdekt en in beslag genomen. Vandaag komen de schilderijen terug naar Amsterdam.  One of two men convicted for stealing two paintings from the Van Gogh Museum in 2002, told his story to the Telegraaf over the weekend. Octave Durham told the newspaper that he and companion Henk B. actually wanted to steal the famous paintings Sunflowers and The Potato Eaters, but the first was too well guarded and the second was too large to fit through the window they broke to get into the museum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Durham and B. eventually made off with two other paintings - Seafront at Scheveningen and Congregation leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen. These paintings were recovered from the Italian mafia last year. Durham would not tell the newspaper how much the Italian mafia paid for them. ""I will not mention an amount. Otherwise I'll get a surcharge from the tax authorities"", he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The paintings were only sold to the Italian mafia after failed attempts to sell them in the Netherlands. Durham and B. initially wanted to sell the paintings to criminal Sam Klepper, but he was assassinated shortly before the robbery. Afterwards they contacted Heineken-kidnapper Cor van Hout, but he too was assassinated before he could buy the paintings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For years Durham denied having anything to do with the robbery in the museum in Amsterdam. He was still convicted in 2005 and sentenced to 3.5 years in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After being recovered, the two paintings were initially considered evidence in the Italian authorities' case against the mafia. But in January a court ruled that they could be released and returned to the Netherlands.","""I'm a born burglar,"" says Octave Durham, per the New York Times, which looks at a new documentary about Durham's notorious theft of two Vincent Van Gogh paintings. Set to be broadcast Tuesday on Dutch TV, the 45-minute special by filmmaker Vincent Verweij gets the inside scoop on the 2002 heist Durham says took less than four minutes and nabbed him two works the Times deems ""of inestimable value"": Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen and View of the Sea at Scheveningen. Durham, who was convicted for the burglary in 2004 and spent just over two years in prison, says he passed cops in his getaway car and brags that he'd pulled off ""more spectacular jobs than this""—after years of denying he had any involvement in the theft, per Versopolis.com. In one reveal that may insult art lovers everywhere, Durham notes he didn't run off with the Van Goghs because of any particular love for the great master, or for art in general: He did it because it was an opportunity for a big get. ""That's the eye of a burglar,"" he says. Per NLTimes.com, Durham told a Dutch paper over the weekend he'd wanted to steal two other Van Gogh paintings—Sunflowers and The Potato Eaters—but one was too big to slip out and the other was under heavy security, so he and partner Henk Bieslijn settled on the other two. The Times notes the Van Gogh Museum is still ""furious"" with Durham, who didn't get paid for the film, and refused to help Verweij. The filmmaker defends his choice of cinematic subject, noting, ""You never see documentaries or articles about art theft from the perspective of the thief."" (The Van Gogh Museum was pretty stoked when the paintings were recovered.)"

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rapper, actor, business mogul and boxing promoter filed for bankruptcy last month on the heels of being ordered to pay $7 million to Lastonia Leviston, who sued him after he allegedly posted a sex tape featuring her online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fiddy (real name: Curtis Jackson III) claims in court he has $25 million in assets, including an $8 million Connecticut mansion, a $572,000 home in Valley Stream, LI, and an Atlanta home worth $464,000.

New bankruptcy filings show he actually owns seven cars, including a Rolls Royce and three Chevy Suburbans, worth $500,000, report People and Page Six. But apparently he still doesn't have a ton of cash to throw around—relatively speaking, anyway. The AP reports the rapper pulls in about $185,000 per month but has $108,000 in monthly expenses, including $72,000 a month for the utilities, mortgage, property tax, and insurance on his 50-room Hartford mansion. Where else is his money going? He spends $9,000 on security, $5,000 on gardening, $1,000 on grooming, and $3,000 on his wardrobe each month. Another $5,745 goes toward a car lease, while $14,600 is used to support his two children and grandfather. On top of all that, he reportedly owes his stylist $5,245 in back pay, as well as unspecified debts to his barber and personal trainer.

"President Donald Trump on Friday announced he would tap current acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie to be the department’s next permanent leader.  Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Trump taps Wilkie as next Veterans Affairs secretary The selection comes after workplace conduct issues sank the nomination of Ronny Jackson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Donald Trump on Friday tapped Robert Wilkie, a veteran GOP aide and acting veterans affairs secretary, as his choice to become the permanent leader of the scandal-plagued agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump announced Wilkie’s selection ahead of scheduled remarks at a White House prison reform summit, telling the crowd that the nominee-in-waiting didn’t know about the news and quipping that he had “ruined the surprise.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ll be informing him in a little while, he doesn’t know this yet, that we’re going to be putting his name up for nomination to be secretary of the veterans administration,” the president said at the event, attended by numerous top Trump administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, senior adviser Jared Kushner and Wilkie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilkie, who has led the Department of Veterans Affairs in an acting capacity since March and was confirmed by the Senate for a Pentagon post last year, rose up and shook hands with the president after the unexpected announcement. In his remarks, the president praised Wilkie for an ""incredible job"" steering the VA in recent months. The White House formally announced the president's intent to nominate Wilkie as VA secretary in a statement later on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a former adviser to Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and longtime Republican hand, Wilkie’s path to taking the VA’s permanent helm will likely be smoother than the turbulent bid of Ronny Jackson, the president’s former personal physician. Jackson withdrew from consideration to lead the VA last month amid scandal over his workplace behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) responded to news of the president's announcement by congratulating the acting agency leader and saying he looked forward to the confirmation process in the chamber.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As acting secretary of the VA, I’ve enjoyed my time getting to know Robert Wilkie and working alongside him to advance community care legislation through Congress,” Isakson said. “I congratulate Undersecretary Wilkie on his nomination and look forward to learning more about his long-term views for the VA, including how he plans to implement the VA MISSION Act when it becomes law, as we work through the confirmation process."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), chairman of the House panel on veterans' affairs, told POLITICO in a statement he found Wilkie ""to be accessible and knowledgeable since he stepped in after former VA Secretary Shulkin's departure."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""While the Senate is responsible for the confirmation process, I commend President Trump for this selection and believe Acting Secretary Wilkie would be an effective permanent secretary,"" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilkie's announced appointment is the latest leadership development for an agency rocked by high-profile departures and ethics scandals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jackson, who served as White House physician under former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as well as Trump, withdrew his bid to lead the VA in April amid a series of allegations that he created a toxic work environment, drunkenly wrecked a car and maintained poor prescription records while serving in the federal government. White House officials later confirmed he would not return to his role at the president's physician. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In March, Trump unveiled on Twitter he was ousting Jackson's predecessor, David Shulkin, amid growing tensions with the White House over a taxpayer-financed trip to Europe last year and after he openly sparred with conservatives in his agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR John Hoellwarth, communications director for the American Veterans non-partisan advocacy group, nodded to the recent upheaval at the agency in his reaction to Trump's announcement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Wilkie is already leading the VA, and the last thing the VA needs is more turnover,"" he told POLITICO in an email. The organization in its statement said Wilkie would provide ""needed stability"" for the VA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest staffing shake-up arrives as congressional lawmakers continue to feud over the future of the agency, with Democrats pushing back against what they say are efforts to nudge the VA closer to privatization. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilkie's nomination could hit a snag due to his tie to the ongoing probe of Trump’s ties to Russia: He was one of three congressional aides present when the Trump campaign supported the rejection of a tough-on-Russia provision proposed for the GOP’s 2016 platform. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is reportedly examining the platform debate, but Wilkie had not been contacted by Mueller as of last fall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arthur Allen contributed to this report.","Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is President Trump's pick to permanently lead the beleaguered department. Wilkie is a former Pentagon undersecretary for personnel and readiness, and a former adviser to GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. He's led the agency for two months, ever since Trump fired David Shulkin amid an internal revolt and questions about his compliance with ethics rules, reports the AP. Wilkie appeared in the White House press briefing room Thursday to accept a check for the amount of Trump's first-quarter salary, which he donated to the agency. Trump revealed his decision during a prison reform event at the White House. Trump previously nominated White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson for the job, but Jackson withdrew last month. Politico sees Wilkie's path to confirmation as much smoother than Jackson's, though it points out one potential wrinkle: Wilkie was one of three congressional aides present when Trump's campaign supported ditching a provision in the GOP's 2016 platform that called for tough action against Russia. Robert Mueller's team is reportedly looking into that campaign decision."

"How Much Water Actually Goes Into Making A Bottle Of Water? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge this image toggle caption Steven Depolo/Flickr Steven Depolo/Flickr NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Environmental activists have long claimed that bottled water is wasteful. Usually, they point to the roughly 50 billion (mostly plastic) bottles we throw away every year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The International Bottled Water Association, ever sensitive to criticism that it's wasting precious resources, has commissioned its first ever study to figure out how much water goes into producing one liter. The results, released this month, show that for North American companies, it takes 1.39 liters to make one liter of water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's less than the global averages of a liter of soda, which requires 2.02 liters of water. A liter of beer, meanwhile, needs 4 liters of water, wine demands 4.74 liters. Hard alcohol, it turns out, is the greediest, guzzling 34.55 liters of water for every liter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This, the bottled water industry says, is evidence that its product isn't so bad. ""Bottled water products are extremely efficient in terms of water use compared to some other packaged beverages,"" says Chris Hogan, spokesman for the International Bottled Water Association. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But water activists say the IBWA study highlights a problem throughout the beverage industry: Few companies take the whole water-use picture into account when calculating their water use. Just as companies are beginning to calculate their carbon footprint, they also need to analyze their water footprints to find opportunities for conservation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bottled water companies (along with many other beverage companies) should include the water in their supply chain, says Ertug Ercin with the Water Footprint Network. Ercin says a true water footprint includes all freshwater used in production, including the water used for packaging. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Packaging makes a significant footprint,"" he says, adding that three liters of water might be used to make a half-liter bottle. In other words, the amount of water going into making the bottle could be up to six or seven times what's inside the bottle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Drilling for oil to make plastic, Ercin says, uses a substantial amount of groundwater. And you need water to make the paper, too, he adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Ercin notes, bottled water packaging uses far less water than soda, which needs extra water to grow sugar and make dyes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hogan says that one reason why the IBWA didnt look at these issues is that it's hard to know where to stop. ""You could extrapolate that ad infinitum,"" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hogan says some companies say they don't think they can get any more efficient, but they're trying. ""Water,"" Hogan says,"" is the lifeblood of the industry and they want to be as efficient as possible.""  Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.","If you think it takes a liter of water to fill a liter water bottle, the International Bottled Water Association has news for you: It takes more than that. NPR reports on the group's first look at the topic, which found that 1.39 liters (or 47 ounces) are needed to make a one-liter bottle (that's about 34 ounces of water); this includes product water and the water needed for things like cleaning and bottling. It arrived at that figure by asking its members to submit three years of detailed data, touching on factors like total water use and the type of treatment used. Writes IBWA, ""The study represents 14.5 million liters of bottled water production, an impressive 43% of total 2011 United States bottled water consumption."" That figure applies to US and Canadian companies, and a rep for the group actually calls that ""extremely efficient."" NPR explains why: A liter of soda demands 2.02 liters of water, while the same quantity of wine requires 4.74 liters. The IBWA chose to stop there in its calculations, but the truth is that the actual ""water footprint"" is much larger: For instance, oil is needed to make plastic, and drilling for it requires, yep, water—in some cases as much as seven times what the plastic bottle ultimately contains."
"The average American woman weighs 166.2 pounds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As reddit recently pointed out, that's almost exactly as much as the average American man weighed in the early 1960s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Men, you're not looking too hot in this scenario either. Over the same time period you gained nearly 30 pounds, from 166.3 in the 60s to 195.5 today. Doing the same comparison as above, today's American man weighs almost as much as 1.5 American women from the 1960s. At 195.5 pounds, put five American guys in a room and you've gathered roughly half a ton of manhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Overall weight gain since 1960 is slightly greater for women (18.5 percent) than for men (17.6 percent). And both sexes have gained roughly an inch in height over the same period, which accounts for some of that weight gain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But story is mostly one of growing girth, and it basically boils down to three factors: we're eating less healthy food, we're eating more of it, and we're not moving around as much.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The average American is 33 pounds heavier than the average Frenchman, 40 pounds heavier than the average Japanese citizen, and a whopping 70 pounds heavier than the average citizen of Bangladesh.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Together, the world's adult human beings added up to 287 million tons of biomass in 2005, according to the BMC Public Health study. But if every country had the same weight distribution as the U.S., the world would be 58 million tons fatter, an increase of 20 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study concludes that ""tackling population fatness may be critical to world food security and ecological sustainability."" And as with so many of the world's problems, the solutions start at home -- on the bathroom scale in this case. But boy, those donuts sure do look delicious.  Atlanta, Ga. (CBS ATLANTA) — The average American woman now weighs as much as the average American man weighed in 1960. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both U.S. men and women have been packing on the pounds since 1960, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that the average American woman now weighs 166.2 pounds – nearly identical to what American men weighed in the 1960s.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC data shows that both sexes have gained almost an inch in height from the 1960s, which factors into some of the overall weight gain. But women have seen an 18.5 percent increase in weight gain from 1960 and men have shown a 17.6 percent increase in overall weight gain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today’s American male weighs nearly as much as 1.5 American females from the 1960s, with today’s U.S. male weighing an average 195.5 pounds and having a nearly 40-inch waist circumference (39.7 inches). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American women today have an average waist circumference of 37.5 inches and weigh in at 166.2 pounds, up from about 140 pounds in 1960. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC data shows that more than one-third (35.1 percent) of U.S. adults over the age of 20 are considered obese.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 1-in-5 U.S. children between the ages of 12-19 are considered obese, with 17.7 percent of kids ages 6-11 also weighing in at obesity levels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 2012 study published in the journal MBC Public Health finds that Americans are now the world’s third-heaviest people, trailing only the Pacific Island countries of Tonga and Micronesia. The average U.S. adult is 33 pounds heavier than the average Frenchman and 70 pounds heavier than the average Bangladeshi citizen. To compile a ton of total mass, it would require only 12.2 Americans in a room versus 20 average citizens of Bangladesh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 2005 BMC Public Health study revealed that the world’s adult human beings make up 287 million tons of biomass, but if every country was as large as the U.S., Earth would be 58 million tons fatter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR — Benjamin Fearnow","Picture the average American couple in the 1960s. Now picture the average American couple today. Something more than questionable fashion should stand out, according to new data from the CDC, which finds the average weight of a US woman is now 166.2 pounds—about the same weight as the average man in the 1960s—up from about 140 pounds during that time, reports the Washington Post. That's an increase of 18.5%. Men, who weighed 166.3 pounds in the 1960s, now tip the scales at an average of 195.5 pounds, for a 17.6% gain. Is it as bad as it seems? Essentially, yes, though the typical height of men and women has grown by an inch, which at least accounts for something. But the main reasons for our growing bellies are no surprise: Americans are eating more food, but less health food, and are exercising less. The data shows 35% of Americans over 20 are considered obese, while 69% of adults are either overweight or obese, reports CBS Atlanta. As for children, one in five between 12 and 19 and 18% between 6 and 11 are obese. A 2012 study found Americans were the third-heaviest people on the planet behind residents of Tonga and Micronesia. The average American was 33 pounds heavier than a Frenchman, 40 pounds heavier than a citizen of Japan, and 70 pounds heavier than a person in Bangladesh, adds the Post. Dying to get back to that 1960s frame? It's actually more important to watch what you eat rather than exercise constantly, though exercising and eating healthy together is obviously beneficial.

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump sent a $25,000 personal check to the family of a fallen soldier the same day that The Washington Post reported that he had promised the soldier's father a personal donation during a June condolence call but never followed through. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A White House official confirms to CNN that the President sent a personal check Wednesday to the family of Army Cpl. Dillon Baldridge Wednesday. Baldridge, 22, was killed in June by an Afghan police officer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The check has been sent,"" Lindsay Walters, White House spokeswoman, told CNN on Wednesday. ""It's disgusting that the media is taking something that should be recognized as a generous and sincere gesture, made privately by the President, and using it to advance the media's biased agenda."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told CNN that it was a personal check from Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The timing of Trump's donation raised questions because the Post reported Wednesday that White House official initially declined to discuss the events in detail but later told them the check had been sent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""'I'm going to write you a check out of my personal account for $25,000,' and I was just floored,"" Baldridge told the Post of his conversation with Trump. ""I could not believe he was saying that, and I wish I had it recorded because the man did say this. He said, 'No other president has ever done something like this,' but he said, 'I'm going to do it. "" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A White House spokesperson, speaking on background, said the check has been ""in the pipeline"" since the President's conversation with the father. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The President has personally followed up several times to ensure that the check was being sent. As stated earlier the check has been sent,"" the spokesperson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked why it took so long for the funds to be sent, the spokesperson added: ""There is a substantial process that can involve multiple agencies anytime the President interacts with the public, especially when transmitting personal funds. In this situation there were other agencies involved."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spokesperson did not say which agencies were involved or elaborate on the process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Knowledge of Trump's pledge to Baldridge comes amid the ongoing flap about how presidents handle condolence calls to families of those killed in action and Trump's feud with a Democratic congresswoman over his call with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed earlier this month in Niger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump called Myeshia Johnson on Tuesday and, according to Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson, the President said that the serviceman killed ""knew what he signed up for, but I guess it still hurt."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump denied that he ever said that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I didn't say what that congresswoman said. Didn't say it at all,"" Trump told reporters during a Wednesday meeting on tax reform in the Cabinet Room. ""She knows it. And she now is not saying it. I did not say what she said."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the same time, the White House is dealing with Trump stating that President Barack Obama didn't call all the families those killed during his presidency and suggesting that reporters ask his chief of staff, retired Gen. John Kelly, whether Obama called him after his son died in Afghanistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kelly's son Robert died when he stepped on a landmine in Afghanistan in 2010. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general, was a lieutenant general at the time.","The father of a soldier killed in Afghanistan in June says he was ""floored"" when President Trump promised to write him a check for $25,000—but it never arrived. Chris Baldridge tells the Washington Post that when Trump called a few weeks after his son, Army Sgt. Dillon Baldridge was killed, he told the president that he and his wife were struggling to deal with the fact that their son and two others were killed by a rogue Afghan police officer instead of in battle. Baldridge, a construction worker in North Carolina, says Trump offered him $25,000 after he complained that his son's $100,000 death benefit would go to his ex-wife instead of his parents, even though he can ""barely rub two nickels"" together. ""He said, 'I'm going to write you a check out of my personal account for $25,000,' and I was just floored,"" Baldridge says. ""He said, 'No other president has ever done something like this.'"" But no check arrived in the following months, and Baldridge says Trump also failed to follow through on a promise to have his staff set up an online fundraiser. CNN reports that when asked about Baldridge's case Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the check ""has been sent."" ""It's disgusting that the media is taking something that should be recognized as a generous and sincere gesture, made privately by the president, and using it to advance the media's biased agenda,"" she said.

The regional logo includes Levi's Stadium as well as notable San Francisco landmarks including the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We think what we have makes a very powerful statement for the NFL brand,"" Weston said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As part of the final testing of the logos, including how the gold would play, the league looked at them on Wilson game footballs and even painted a logo on the playing surface at Candlestick Park last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following the conclusion of Super Bowl XLIX, which will be played at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Arizona on Feb. 1, 2015, the league will embark on a campaign to play up the 50th anniversary. The NFL will go back to using roman numerals for Super Bowl LI in Houston in 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The league started using the word ""Super Bowl"" for the third game in 1969. The league filed to trademark the term two months later.  For the first time since the fourth Super Bowl, no Roman numerals will be affixed to the 50th Super Bowl. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The NFL has released the logo for Super Bowl 50, which will take place in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2016, and the logo uses the Arabic numeral 50, rather than the Roman numeral L. Roman numerals have been used since Super Bowl V. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives from the host committee had been lobbying the NFL to allow them to ditch the ‘L’ and it appears that they have succeeded. Perhaps some promotional materials for the game will use Super Bowl L, but most will use the official logo with its great big 50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The NFL says Roman numerals are not disappearing for good, and the 2017 game will be Super Bowl LI.","Quick, how many Super Bowls have there been? If you don't know, it's probably because this year's game was promoted as Super Bowl XLVIII—and you'd be forgiven if your Roman numeral skills are rusty. Well, good news, my ancient-number-system-challenged friends: In 2016, the NFL is ditching the letters, ABC News reports. The game's logo will simply say ""Super Bowl 50."" This is a one-time thing, however. ""When we developed the Super Bowl XL logo, that was the first time we looked at the letter 'L,'"" explains the NFL's VP of branding. ""And, at that moment, that's when we started to wonder what will happen when we get to 50?"" After much consideration, the brand team decided that ""Super Bowl L"" would look dumb, and so decided to give us a brief Roman numeral reprieve. It will be the first Super Bowl without Roman numerals since 1970's Super Bowl 4. But 2017's game will be Super Bowl LI, notes NBC Sports."
"DHAKA, March 2 Bangladesh's anti-terrorism unit said it had arrested on Monday the main suspect in the killing of a U.S. blogger who was hacked to death in Dhaka last week in the latest attack on critics of religious extremism in the Muslim-majority nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forces from the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) arrested Farabi Shafiur Rahman, who was previously jailed for his ties to the extremist Hizbut Tahrir Islamist group, at a bus stop in Dhaka, a RAB spokesman told reporters.

"The Thick Have Their Needs, Too Michael Bay’s ‘Pain & Gain,’ With Mark Wahlberg NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To describe “Pain & Gain” as a Michael Bay movie on steroids would be accurate but also redundant and a little misleading. Pumped-up, aggressive, muscle-headed entertainment is Mr. Bay’s specialty, after all, and while this grisly true-crime drama is partly about performance-enhancing drugs and the bulky men who love them, it is also, compared with “Armageddon” or the “Transformers” series, a stripped-down, modest enterprise in which no major American city is reduced to rubble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is not to suggest that the film, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and based on a series of articles by Pete Collins (published in Miami New Times), is in any way subtle or restrained. The opening scene, a police chase from which the rest of the story flashes back, sets a tone of hectic excess. Mark Wahlberg, running from the heavily armed forces of law and order, dashes across rooftops and lumbers, sometimes in slow motion, through streets and alleys. The camera swirls around him, freezing as a glob of saliva pops out of his mouth, dropping down to allow us a peek up his nostrils and then tilting and sliding to register the impact of his face on the windshield of a car. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What follows is two hours of sweat, blood and cheerful, nasty vulgarity, punctuated by voice-over ruminations about Jesus, physical fitness and the American dream, along with a few tactical visits to a strip club. It all leaves you pondering whether you have just seen a monumentally stupid movie or a brilliant movie about the nature and consequences of stupidity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why choose? “Pain & Gain,” though it compresses some events and characters, hews fairly close to the facts as related in Mr. Collins’s deadpan chronicle of idiotic criminality and sloppy police work. Mr. Wahlberg plays Daniel Lugo, a personal trainer and bodybuilding enthusiast who lands a job at a Miami gym after serving time for an investment scam. Swearing that he has learned his lesson — that there is no substitute for hard work — he sets his sights on a South Florida vision of the good life, egged on by a self-help guru (Ken Jeong) who fills his head with slogans and three-point plans for success. “If I deserve it,” Daniel says, “then the universe will serve it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What he feels the universe owes him is more or less what a teenage boy raised on “Entourage,” Grand Theft Auto and the oeuvre of Michael Bay might demand, though, since “Pain & Gain” is set in 1995, not all of those inspirations are available to Daniel. But the world, then as now, is full of hot babes, fast cars and money, tokens of a high-rolling, hedonistic existence just beyond poor Daniel’s reach. He is motivated less by ambition than by a self-pitying sense of entitlement that is both democratic and Nietzschean. He says that he wants to be just like everybody else but also that he wants to set himself apart from the losers and suckers in whose ranks he unfairly languishes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One day at the gym, Daniel spots a ticket out of palookaville in the person of Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub), a pigeon-chested blowhard who hires Daniel to help him get into shape and brags endlessly about his offshore bank accounts, his boat, his mansion and the sandwich franchise near the airport that for some reason is his pride and joy. Victor is enough of a jerk that it is hard to feel too bad when Daniel enlists two fellow gym rats — Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul (Dwayne Johnson) — to kidnap him. Rather than demand ransom, they decide to torture him into signing his assets over to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adrian and Paul have dreams of their own. Adrian’s are to overcome his steroid-related sexual problems and to win the love of Robin (Rebel Wilson), a nurse who specializes in such ailments. Paul, an ex-convict who has found religion, is a bit less clear about what he wants, and he clings to a sense of his own righteousness, even after some dramatic backsliding. Some of this occurs in the company of Sorina (Bar Paly), a Romanian-born stripper who had previously dated Daniel and who believes that he and his partners are government agents on a dangerous, top-secret mission.  At least Wahlberg is matched by guys who can punch his weight. Mackie gets to jack up the nutsiness and still make Adrian the voice of reason. And Johnson perfectly blends the two sides of his screen persona. Always one-part supersized tough guy and two parts endearing family star, Johnson finds the humor in a man roasting severed hands on a grill as much as he does the soul of a guy gripping tight to redemption in the midst of 'roid rage.","Michael Bay's latest movie is a bit of a shift from Transformers—it's a smaller-budget film based on a true story about bodybuilders who get involved in kidnapping. Critics offer mixed reviews: At Salon, Andrew O'Hehir calls Pain & Gain ""a thoroughly reprehensible and frequently hilarious satire that depicts American life as a circus of stupidity, artificiality, and self-regard."" Bay, he notes, ""sends a clear message to those of us who've been making fun of him: He's been in on the joke the whole time."" ""Compared with Armageddon or the Transformers series,"" this is ""a stripped-down, modest enterprise in which no major American city is reduced to rubble,"" notes AO Scott in the New York Times. It ""leaves you pondering whether you have just seen a monumentally stupid movie or a brilliant movie about the nature and consequences of stupidity."" But ""why choose?"" ""The combination of the words 'Michael Bay' and 'steroids' should be enough to give any moviegoer pause,"" observes Liam Lacey in the Globe and Mail. The film ""plays like Goodfellas as performed by the Three Stooges. As a genre-mashing exercise it’s almost interesting, but, really, why bother?"" ""Pain & Gain is arguably too much of everything—everyone jabbers on incessantly, and the movie is in love with its own outrageousness,"" writes Joe Neumaier in the New York Daily News. ""But its biggest lift comes from the pumped-up (Mark) Wahlberg and (Dwayne) Johnson. They manage to find the humanity in all the adrenalized muscle."""

"We probably all saw this coming, given that this was one of the biggest media stories of the last week — Saturday Night LIve opened the show with a comment from Rush Limbaugh on the fallout from his remarks about Georgetown student Sandra Fluke. Up and coming cast MVP Taran Killam played the cranky radio host, who chastised the “sluts” at Turbo Tax and other sponsors for deserting him after his unpopular rants about birth control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sketch was amusing in its dedication to coming up with bizarre sponsors for Limbaugh’s show (“Depends For Racists,” anyone?) but even Killam’s shouty, dedicated delivery couldn’t distract from the reality that the sketch was the same joke repeated about twenty times, making it feel longer than Rush’s actual show. HEY-O! “There could be a nuclear apocalypse, and I would still be right here calling the cockroaches sluts.” I’m sure that’s true, Rush, but luckily we didn’t have to stick around to see it — that was the sign off for the sketch.

"Engadget claims that Barnes & Noble is phasing out the 3G Nook. Does that mean a new Nook is coming? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gone baby gone? (Credit: Barnes & Noble) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We're not sure quite what to make of this rumor, but Engadget is reporting that Barnes & Noble is phasing out the Nook 3G. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Engadget doesn't cite a specific person or anonymous source, but says it, ""Received hard evidence from within B&N; that the Nook is being discontinued, with sales to seemingly continue until stock is exhausted."" The ""outfit"" (we assume that means Barnes & Noble) is apparently ""encouraging retail partners to not send out any 'bulk requests' for the Nook 3G, as there simply 'will not be sufficient quantities to fulfill those orders.'"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The article then goes on to say that ""the company never actually received a huge amount of Nook 3G bulk orders to begin with, so maybe Wi-Fi really is everywhere these days."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As we said, it's a little hard to decipher what this means, but we should point out that Engadget's story about the Nook Color getting an update to Android 2.2 and possibly blowing up if you rooted it (installed custom Android firmware) ended up being just a tad off base. However, this latest story was written by veteran Engadget reporter Darren Murph, so we're taking it more seriously. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One thing worth pointing out is that it would seem odd for Barnes & Noble to discontinue the 3G/Wi-Fi version of the Nook and tell customers they could only get the Wi-Fi-only version. The fact is, Amazon offers both a 3G/Wi-Fi Kindle and Wi-Fi-only Kindle, and Barnes & Noble would most likely continue to offer models that compete with what Amazon's got. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Barnes & Noble remains heavily focused on marketing the Nook Color, the more likely scenario is for the company to refresh the Nook e-ink line, which launched in November 2009. Whether that ends up being a substantial makeover or just some modest design and parts tweaks is unclear, but some industry insiders say that Barnes & Noble may be losing money on its e-ink readers (which is why it hasn't quite matched Amazon's prices). Therefore it would behoove the company to release a product that was more cost-effective to produce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In any case, we think that Barnes & Noble will continue to offer some sort of sub-$200 3G-enabled Nook as long as Amazon is offering one. But to be clear, that's just speculation. We have no ""hard evidence"" to prove some change is coming to the Nook line, and Barnes & Noble doesn't comment on rumors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: A Barnes & Noble rep told us that the Nook 3G sold very well during the holidays and remains on sale both in Barnes & Noble stores and in its retail partners stores. She would not comment on the Nook ""roadmap"" going forward.  When it comes to eReaders, it looks like customers prefer to have a WiFi-only model. Despite Barnes & Noble's Nook product line showing all-time sales highs (thanks in no small part to the uber-popular Nook Color), the e-ink Nook 3G is apparently about to be discontinued, according to an Engadget tipster. Sales will continue until supply is depleted, but after that, don't expect to see any more of these. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As eReaders only need data connections for downloading books (usually not something you'll do everyday) and syncing, it makes perfect sense that more customers opt for a cheaper WiFi model. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's been a slice, Nook 3G. [Engadget]","Barnes & Noble's Nook e-reader is quite popular—but apparently, just the WiFi-only version. The bookseller is discontinuing the model with 3G, reports Engadget, and apparently will continue sales only until the current stock runs out. The move makes sense, writes Will Shanklin on AndroidCentral.com: Because e-readers require data connections only when the user is downloading books or syncing, ""it makes perfect sense that more customers opt for a cheaper wi-fi model."" But CNET cautions that other so-called scoops about the Nook turned out to be false."

The now-viral video, recorded from the other side of the enclosure by what sounds to be a young woman, shows the man slowly climbing over a railing, then reaching down to slap the butt of 4-year-old Rosie, who appeared to be snacking alongside her mother, Mara.

"This undated photo taken by Mexican Authorities and provided Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2013 by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice shows Juan Salaz.AP/Texas Department of Criminal Justice NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Texas prison escapee on the run for almost 16 years has been captured by authorities in Mexico and awaits extradition to the U.S. to finish serving his sentence on charges of attempted capital murder of a police officer, state Department of Criminal Justice officials said Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Juan Salaz was apprehended last week. The 37-year-old American citizen had been sought for years by authorities on both sides of the border. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Salaz escaped the night of March 22, 1997, from the Garza East prison in Beeville in South Texas by climbing over three 16-foot fences all topped with razor wire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, he was serving three concurrent 35-year sentences for aggravated kidnapping with a deadly weapon and two counts of attempted capital murder of a police officer for a 1995 incident involving two Houston officers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He now also faces a felony escape charge besides serving the remainder of his sentence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prison records show on April 2, 1995, Salaz and another man, Geronimo Soto Alvarado, abducted a man at gunpoint and demanded a ransom. Houston police undercover officers involved in the case arranged for the exchange. After the abducted man was freed, they identified themselves as police and Salaz and Alvarado opened fire on them. A police sergeant avoided serious injury when he was saved by his body armor. Another officer suffered a hand wound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Salaz was seriously wounded when police returned fire. He recovered from his injuries and subsequently pleaded guilty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alvarado, now 45, also was arrested and is serving a life sentence for two convictions of aggravated assault and another for aggravated kidnapping. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prison officials said sources for years had told them Salaz was hiding out in Mexico but he managed to evade police. The hunt for him involved the U.S. Marshals Service, the Texas prison system's Office of Inspector General and Mexican law enforcement agencies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Salaz thought that he had eluded authorities by starting a new life in Mexico,"" Department of Criminal Justice Inspector General Bruce Toney said Wednesday. ""He was wrong."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Salaz is to be returned to Texas custody once the Mexican government approves his extradition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Salaz's capture leaves Jose Fernando Bustos-Diaz, 24, as the lone Texas prison fugitive. He fled in April 2010 from the Brisco Unit in Dilley, near San Antonio. The prison houses medium- and minimum-security inmates. He also is believed to have fled to Mexico. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bustos-Diaz was serving 35 years for a 2005 murder in Harris County.

"Video screenshot by Eric Mack/CNET NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I think we can now officially say that NASA's real-life mission concepts have met, if not exceeded, the wildest dreams of Jules Verne and the other early futurists. Verne saw us flying around the world, traveling to the center of the Earth (not a great idea, it turns out) and to the moon, but I bet he never imagined that just 110 years after his death, we'd be working on a robot submarine to probe the flammable seas of a distant world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Truth can be stranger than fiction, indeed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this month, NASA published the below video introducing its concept submarine designed to explore Kraken Mare, one of the methane seas on Titan, the remarkably strange moon circling Saturn. Even if it were possible for humans to go swimming in Titan's seas, it might not be advisable. It would be something like swimming in a freezing ocean of liquefied natural gas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clearly, this is a mission meant for a drone, specifically a nuclear-powered, single-ton robotic submarine equipped with a seafloor camera and sampling system as described in a brief (PDF) on the concept posted online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getting the sub to Titan presents a bit of challenge since it won't fit into the sphere-cone shaped landers that have typically been used for planetary exploration in the past. However, it could fit into a space plane like Boeing's X-37, which was recently orbiting the Earth for some sort of classified, likely spy-ish US Air Force mission. The space plane would make a soft water landing on Kraken Mare and jettison the sub, or possibly drop it at low altitude via a parachute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to floating or diving around checking out the chemistry of Titan's sea and sea floor composition, the sub could also study the moon's tides, weather, shoreline, disappearing islands and keep an eye out for any evidence of really weird life forms that like to hang out in super chilly, gassy locales. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Titan sub concept is very preliminary at this point, but there's plenty of time to work on it. The team behind it anticipates that it might not splashdown until sometime around 2047.  Human exploration of planets and moons in the solar system has thus far taken place on dry land, thanks largely to the lack of liquid water on most celestial bodies. The NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program has developed a concept for a robotic submersible vehicle for planetary exploration, but it won’t be deployed in water. The aptly (though unimaginatively) named Titan Submarine Phase I Conceptual Design could some day go for a dip in the hydrocarbon lakes of Saturn’s moon Titan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Titan has always been an interesting target for study because it’s so unusual for a moon. It’s larger than Mercury and has an atmosphere one-and-a-half times as dense as Earth’s. The atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and methane with hints of hydrogen, so certainly nothing that would support life as we know it. Titan’s temperature can reach a positively frigid -179 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit). These super-low temperatures and thick atmosphere combine to create the feature scientists are so anxious to study in detail — vast lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Data from the Voyager, Cassini, and Huygens (deployed by Cassini) probes have confirmed that there are three large polar seas on Titan’s surface, and the largest of them is known as Kraken Mare. This is the target for NASA’s Titan submarine as it would provide the most opportunities for exploration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The conditions in Kraken Mare would be challenging to say the least. The massive hydrocarbon lake has an area of 400,000 sq km (154,000 sq miles) and is believed to be as much as 160 meters (525 feet) deep. There are also currents and tides to deal with, and it’s not like mission control could just nudge the submersible this way or that whenever it needed. Titan is about 80 light minutes away, so that means NASA would have to wait 160 minutes to get a response after each command was sent. Real time control is out of the question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA engineers estimate the Titan Submarine would weigh in at about one ton and make use of electrically-powered turbines to get around the liquid methane lake. Titan is far from the Sun, making solar power inefficient, and the sub would spend most of its time beneath the surface where solar panels wouldn’t work anyway. Like many deep space probes, the sub would rely on a radiothermal Stirling generator to produce about 1kW of power. The concept submersible could reach speeds of about one meter per second, according to NASA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There aren’t many details on exactly what sort of instruments the Titan sub would carry, but the data obtained would be transmitted back to Earth in an unusual way. Rather than introduce the complication of an orbital component to act as a link with NASA, the sub itself would have a large dorsal fin with a built-in planar phased-array antenna. It would surface for 16 hours per day to beam data back before sinking once more beneath the methane waves. Surfacing and diving will be controlled with ballast tanks, just like an Earth-bound sub, but the details have yet to be worked out. Methane and ethane don’t work quite like water, and there’s concern nitrogen gas could condense in the tanks, dropping the sub to the bottom of Kraken Mare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is still just an early concept of a possible future mission. NASA estimates some descendant of the Titan Submarine Phase I Conceptual Design could reach Titan around 2040, but there’s a lot of work to do before then. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now read: A tribute to Cassini: 10 years spent revealing the secrets of Saturn and its moons","Saturn's moon Titan, which happens to be larger than the planet Mercury, is cold. Very cold. As in -290 degrees Fahrenheit is not out of the ordinary. These super low temps, combined with an atmosphere roughly 1.5 times as dense as Earth's, have resulted in a few extraordinary bodies of liquid methane and ethane, reports Extreme Tech, and scientists are anxious to explore their depths. (In fact, Titan is the only body aside from Earth to boast liquid lakes on its surface.) So NASA is working up a (very early) model of a submarine drone that could do just that—one that CNET reports will likely be nuclear-powered, weigh a ton, and come equipped with a seafloor camera, sampling system, and other fancy futuristic robotic accoutrements. But don't get too excited just yet. First, this is a fully automated mission: ""Even if it were possible for humans to go swimming in Titan's seas,"" notes CNET, it ""would be something like swimming in a freezing ocean of liquefied natural gas."" Hence, NASA's goal of sending the ""highly capable science craft"" to Titan's largest sea, Kraken Mare, around the year 2040, in what it calls ""an unprecedented planetary exploration mission."" Many details remain to be sorted out, including how to get the craft to Titan (Boeing's X-37 is a possibility), how to land it (parachute drop), and while there, how to communicate with Earthlings (planar phased-array antenna). (Something else on Titan has been stumping NASA.)"
"Lying five feet below the surface, the tunnel stretched for 32 feet from one of the barracks and under the barbwire fences surrounding the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its discovery provides the first physical evidence of prisoners trying to dig their way out of a Nazi death camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The length of the tunnel gives an indication of the ingenuity of prisoners desperate to escape a camp that claimed the lives of an estimated 250,000 in the 17 months of its operations in German-occupied Poland .

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sonderkommando was comprised of prisoners tasked with herding victims to the gas chambers and disposing of the bodies. Their function at Sobibor would have spared them the death on arrival that awaited so many of the camp's victims, and given them the time to excavate the tunnel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tunnel's discoverers believe it is unlikely that anybody ever used it to escape the camp. There were no reports of successful escape attempts from Sobibor until 600 prisoners broke out during an armed uprising in October 1943. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts said that the tunnel was probably discovered, and everybody who might have been connected with it executed. The excavation was apparently then filled in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its discovery has shed new light on the history of a camp of which little is known in comparison to other German extermination sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Few people survived Sobibor. Not long after the uprising, Himmler ordered the camp to be razed to the ground and trees planted in an attempt to erase all traces of the facility.  Traces of an escape tunnel have been uncovered at the site of an infamous Nazi death camp in Poland, according to news reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeologists say the passageway, found 5 feet (1.5 meters) below the surface, spanned 32 feet (10 m) and reached beyond the barbed-wire border surrounding the extermination camp at Sobibor, The Telegraph reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We were excavating near where the sonderkommando barrack was and we came across two rows of buried barbed wire,"" Polish archaeologist Wojciech Mazurek was quoted as saying by The Telegraph. ""Digging down we found the traces of the tunnel. It was about as wide as a human, and we are 99 percent certain that it was an escape tunnel."" [8 Grisly Archaeological Discoveries] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sobibor was operated in German-occupied eastern Poland between 1942 and 1943. Estimates for the number of people killed there range from 167,000 to upwards of 250,000. Virtually all of the victims were Jews and most were gassed upon arrival. Some prisoners were spared immediate death and kept in the work units known as the sonderkommando, forced to help in the gas chamber operations and the disposal of bodies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers digging at the site reportedly don't have any evidence that the newly discovered escape tunnel was ever actually used. Prisoners at Sobibor did, however, stage an uprising in October 1943. Six-hundred prisoners revolted and managed to kill nearly a dozen of their guards. Many of the 300 laborers who broke out of the extermination camp were eventually captured and killed, and only 50 escapees are believed to have survived the war. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the uprising, Nazi officials leveled the camp and covered its traces. That makes work difficult for archaeologists trying to understand the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The area we were excavating has been disturbed and plundered many times over the years since the war,"" Yoram Haimi, an Israeli archaeologist who is also investigating the camp, was quoted as saying by Haaretz. ""It's a mess containing human bones, human ash, glass, pieces of metal and a lot of waste."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Excavations have been underway at Sobibor for more than a decade. In addition to the escape tunnel, the team has reportedly found a crematorium, human skeletal remains, and dozens of artifacts including eye glasses, jewelry and sobering personal items, like a Mickey Mouse pin, that seem to have belonged to children.

"The Labor Department on Friday reported December jobs gains were much lower than expected as the year ended. U.S. payrolls rose 74,000 last month, the smallest rise in three years, while the unemployment rate dropped to 6.7%, Labor said Friday. Here are highlights: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Revisions: Employment gains for November and October were revised upward by a total of 38,000. Employers added 241,000 jobs in November, up from an initially reported 203,000. October’s gain was unrevised at 200,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jobless Rate: The December unemployment rate decreased to 6.7%, from 7.0% the prior month, but that was because more people dropped out of the workforce rather than found new jobs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yearly Figures: For 2013, employers added an average of 182,000 jobs each month. That is roughly in line with 2012, when payrolls expanded by about 183,000 positions each month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Participation Rate: The December civilian labor force participation rate was 62.8%, weaker from a month earlier. It is also down from 63.6% in December 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Longer-run Trend: December’s mild advance held back longer-term averages. Monthly job gains averaged 172,000 over the past three months, which was in line as well with the six-month trend. For the first half of 2013, payrolls expanded by 195,000 each month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Winners: In December, employment rose in the retail sector, which added 55,000 new jobs. Other strong gains came from the wholesale trade industry (15,000) and professional and business services (19,000). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Losers: But employment in the construction sector was down by 16,000. Some economists had predicted before the report that colder weather could be to blame. The federal government’s workforce continued to shrink, with 7,000 fewer positions last month from November. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earnings and Work Week: The average work week for private employees edged down to 34.4 hours last month from the prior month. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings for private employees rose by 2 cents to $24.17 from a month earlier. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 42 cents.  WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added a scant 74,000 jobs in December, the fewest in three years. The disappointing gain ends 2013 on a weak note after recent economic reports had raised hopes for a strong finish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Labor Department says the unemployment rate fell from 7 percent in November to 6.7 percent, the lowest level since October 2008. But the drop occurred partly because more Americans stopped looking for jobs. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively searching for work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cold weather may have slowed hiring. Construction firms cut 16,000 jobs, the biggest drop in 20 months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR December's hiring is far below the average gain of 214,000 jobs a month in the preceding four months. But monthly gains averaged 182,000 last year, nearly matching the previous two years.","A pretty dismal number on today's jobs report: Just 74,000 jobs were created in December, the smallest monthly increase in three years; economists had expected 200,000. And while the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% from 7.0%, it was ""for all the wrong reasons,"" writes Steven Russolillo at the Wall Street Journal. Specifically, the big drop can be explained by the fact that the participation rate fell to a new low of 62.8%, meaning fewer people were looking for work. The AP reports that cold weather could have played a role in the poor numbers, noting that construction firms cut 16,000 jobs—the largest drop in 20 months. One silver lining from the report: November's new jobs were revised upward to 241,000 from 203,000. And Russolillo writes that the same could happen here. ""Something doesn’t smell right. This jobs number is so far out of whack from the recent economic data that have come out. Jobs data have been getting stronger for months, not to mention improvements in growth, housing, and manufacturing figures. Don't be surprised if this report gets revised higher in the coming months."""

Lady Gaga 's latest album may be getting stellar reviews in the US, but overseas, in Lebanon, 'Born This Way' isn't getting the same warm reception. According to NME , Gaga's freedom of self anthem album is getting the lockdown -- thousands of copies of the album were impounded by Lebanese authorities due to Gaga's lyrics which they believe are ""offensive to Christianity.""But the space age artist shouldn't be too surprised by the country's reception of the full album. The singer's recent single, 'Judas,' was also banned from Lebanon's radio stations. Malaysia has also displayed similar responses to the album, banning the title track from their radio stations because they believed it was ""promoting homosexuality."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were even rumblings from the US Catholic League in anticipation of Gaga's 'Judas' video and it's religious affiliations. But after the video was released, it's convoluted message and imagery laid to rest any criticism from the League.Do you think Gaga is pushing the envelope too far?  Lady Gaga's religious firestorm may have blown over in the United States, but the government of Lebanon found it so enflaming that they've banned the popstar's new album from the country's stores. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Multiple reports say that the Lebanese government impounded shipments of ""Born This Way,"" the already-platinum album due to its alleged insults to Christianity and its all around ""bad taste."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Lebanese government has made clear their distaste in Gaga, having already banned her single ""Judas"" from the airwaves. That song caused a brief ruckus in the United States, too, as conservative religious leaders, including those from the Catholic League, initially protested the song's lyrics and pending video. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""This is a stunt... Lady Gaga tries to continue to shock Catholics and Christians in general: she dresses as a nun... she swallows the rosary. She has now morphed into a caricature of herself,"" Catholic League President Bill Donohue said in a statement before the video came out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He then sang a somewhat different tune, waving off the video as a mess and incoherent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Metro UK, the song ""Born This Way"" was banned from radio play by the government of Malaysia, too. In response to that banning, Gaga, responded, ""What I would say is for all the young people in Malaysia that want those words to be played on the radio, it is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Born This Way"" went platinum in its first week out, selling 1.1 million copies in the United States alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to one Lebanese blogger, he had already downloaded the album via Amazon, with the songs existing safely in the cloud; so, many Lebanese still have the ability to listen to Gaga's latest opus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a prescient comment, in a recent feature in the British newspaper The Guardian, Gaga decried religion's impact on government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The influence of institutionalised religion on government is vast. So religion then begins to affect social values and that in turn affects self-esteem, bullying in school, teen suicides, all those things,"" she told the paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lebanon has a history of banning entertainment they find religiously offensive; in 2004, they banned the Tom Hanks-starring big screen adaptation of ""The Da Vinci Code.""","Lady Gaga's new album has had insane sales, but apparently not in Lebanon, the Sun reports. The Middle Eastern country banned Born This Way from its stores and impounded a shipment of the album.

An Escambia Academy High School student who wore an eagle feather on her graduation cap was denied her diploma after graduating May 23. According to a contract issued by the school in Atmore, Alabama, 17-year-old Chelsey Ramer, of the Poarch Creek Band of Indians, would not receive her diploma or high school transcripts until she paid a $1,000 fine for wearing the feather. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I feel like this wasn’t fair. It felt like it wasn’t legal,” Ramer said. “It really did hurt my feelings. I have watched others wear it and I looked forward to it my whole four years there. Now when it was my turn, [they said] I couldn’t.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ramer said American Indian seniors four years ago wore feathers to the school’s graduation, but because it was a surprise to the school, no action was taken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “About two months ago, me and the other Indian seniors from the graduating class asked our headmaster if we could wear the feathers on our caps. She told us ‘no’ and that if we did, she would pull us off the field,” Ramer said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ramer says soon after their request, the school gave graduating students a contract that they had to sign or they would not be able to participate in graduation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I never signed that paper,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The contract outlined rules for what to wear at the graduation ceremony. It forbid any “extraneous items during graduation exercises.” It also said students violating the contract would not get their diplomas until appropriate disciplinary actions were taken and students paid a $1,000 fine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ramer decided that expressing her Native heritage with an eagle feather was worth the consequences. Of the other three Native seniors at Escambia, one wore a feather on a necklace and did not face any disciplinary actions; the other two did not wear a feather at all for fear of being fined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Ramer was nervous on graduation day, she had been looking forward to wearing that eagle feather for four years, so she wore it with pride. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I got my friend behind me to put it on my tassel, I went down the field. They didn't say anything, but you could tell the staff and the headmaster was upset. But everybody clapped for me,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though no one addressed the issue during the ceremony, she was not given a diploma. “I turned in my cap and gown and they just looked at me,” Ramer said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Ramer visited the administrative office on May 29 to speak with Headmaster Betty Warren, she was told Warren was no longer with the school. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the school’s website, David Walker, the girls’ basketball coach is now serving as the interim headmaster. It is unclear if this change is related to the graduation incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I went in today to talk to Mrs. Warren and they told me she had gotten fired,” Ramer said. “I looked in her office and it was already cleaned out… I asked why she got fired and the people told me they didn't know. I didn’t say anything, but Coach Walker said some people from Indian country were calling him and asking for a statement, but he didn’t know what to tell them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alex Alvarez, Creek, a former teacher of Ramer’s and family friend who attended the graduation ceremony, says the situation is frustrating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think this is ridiculous. If they took the time to understand and respect the differences in individuals, this would have never happened,” he said. “We don’t have much left as Indian people, to give a child an eagle feather as an achievement should be adhered to.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alvarez said for the past two months parents and tribal council members had requested to speak with school board members to discuss the issue of the eagle feather but such requests were never granted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The kicker is that this is a private school,” Alvarez continued. “Private institutions still have to follow federal guidelines, especially in regards to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alvarez even wrote to his local newspaper, The Atmore Advance, citing these concerns, but the school didn’t change its stance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ICTMN made several attempts to contact the school for a comment, but none were returned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ramer still does not have her diploma.

"I often feel guilt when I assign a story. This is partly a function of being a woman who would, if she had her way, please and comfort her entire universe of acquaintances, and partly a function of having been convinced at a relatively young age by the argument that Janet Malcolm famously made in The Journalist and the Murderer: “Every journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR  Product Description NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The oldest daughter of Sarah Palin and single mother goes beyond the headlines, offering readers an inside look at her life, her world, and the things that matter most, including her family and the faith that keeps her centered. When her mother became the Republican Vice-Presidential candidate in 2008, Bristol Palin was instantly propelled into the national spotlight, becoming the focus of intense public and national media scrutiny at the age of seventeen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Not Afraid of Life, Bristol gives readers an intimate behind-the-scenes look at her life for the first time, from growing up in Alaska to coming of age amid the media and political frenzy surrounding her mother’s political rise; from becoming a single mother while still a teenager to coping as her relationship with her baby’s father crumbled publicly—not once, but twice. Bristol talks about the highs and lows of her appearance on ABC-TV’s Dancing with the Stars, including the aching hours of practice, the biting criticisms, and the thrill of getting to the show’s finals. She speaks candidly of her aspirations for the future and the deep religious faith that gives her strength and inspiration.

"Wayne Flynt was a close friend of Harper Lee until her death in 2016, one of the few she still granted visits after she entered a nursing home near the end of her life. Before that, Flynt, professor emeritus of history at Auburn University and author of numerous books on Alabama history, corresponded with Lee through letters since their initial meeting in 1983. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With a sure-to-be bestseller on the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" debuting Tuesday, author Wayne Flynt discussed Harper Lee in an exclusive interview with the New York Times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Flynt's book, ""Mockingbird Songs: My Friendship With Harper Lee"" offers insight into the famously publicity shy Lee, including some confirmations of much-discussed topics such as her relationship with Truman Capote and if she would have approved of this book. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Release date set for Wayne Flynt's book on friendship with Harper Lee NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here are just a few of the things we learned from the in-depth interview: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Lee, known in her hometown of Monroeville by her given name of Nelle Harper Lee, only asked Flynt not to write about her while she was living. Flynt told the NYT he feels the book ""allows her to speak beyond the grave and without any risk to her privacy."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. One reason Lee shied away from the media and the glare of fame's spotlight was her fear of obsessive fans. She once had a stalker and was concerned with stalkers and assassination, Flynt told the NYT. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Truman Capote was a compulsive liar. Lee and Capote were childhood friends in Monroeville and he was the inspiration for the character Dill in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Lee's friendship with Capote eventually ended over jealousy. Lee wrote to Flynt: ""I did something Truman could not forgive: I wrote a novel that sold.""

Lee was so nervous before interviews and speaking engagements that she would vomit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. Flynt admits Lee ""may not have fully participated in the decision to publish a long forgotten and flawed first novel ('Go Set a Watchman')"" because of her age and health issues. However, Flynt said that at the time, Lee welcomed its publication. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Click here to read the detailed interview in the New York Times.  According to a new book out on May 2 from her longtime friend and confidante, Harper Lee called Truman Capote a ""compulsive l[iar]"" in her letters. Lee and Capote were friends and writing partners for years, and it's widely known that Lee based the To Kill a Mockingbird character Dill Harris on the In Cold Blood author. Lee's revelation about Capote's lying habit comes from a March 2006 letter to Wayne Flynt, one of many contained in Flynt's forthcoming Mockingbird Songs: My Friendship with Harper Lee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Lee and Capote achieved literary success in the mid-20th century. Following the sensational Clutter murders in 1959, the two writers traveled to Kansas so that Capote could cover the story for The New Yorker. Lee worked as Capote's ""assistant researchist"" in Kansas, and later edited his final draft of In Cold Blood. She also published her own article about the murders in the March 1960 issue of the FBI trade magazine Grapevine. But when he published In Cold Blood in 1966, Capote gave Lee no credit for her hard work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lee's letters to Flynt reveal a reason for Capote's snub. After writing that ""Capote’s drinking and misery soured their friendship,"" according to The New York Times, Lee told Flynt: ""I was his oldest friend, and I did something Truman could not forgive: I wrote a novel that sold . . . He nursed his envy for more than 20 years."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read all about Truman Capote's ""compulsive lying"" and more when Mockingbird Songs comes out on May 2.","In the soon-to-be published contents of a decade-old letter, Harper Lee accused her ""oldest friend,"" Truman Capote, of being an inveterate liar who destroyed their friendship with his jealousy. Wayne Flynt, an Alabama historian and longtime friend of Lee's in his own right, is publishing a book next week about his quarter-century relationship with the To Kill a Mockingbird author, the New York Times reports. According to AL.com, Flynt was one of a handful of people still allowed to visit Lee after she moved into a nursing home in the final years of her life. Flynt tells the Times that Lee, who removed herself from public life in the 1960s, only told him not to write about her while she was alive. Capote and Lee had been writing partners for years, and she even based a character in To Kill a Mockingbird on him, Bustle reports. But in a 2006 letter to Flynt, Lee said of Capote: ""His compulsive lying was like this: If you said, 'Did you know JFK was shot?' He'd easily answer, 'Yes, I was driving the car he was riding in.'"" She also said that while their friendship was strained by Capote's drinking and ""misery,"" it was ultimately ruined by jealousy. ""I did something Truman could not forgive: I wrote a novel that sold,"" she wrote. ""He nursed his envy for more than 20 years."" To Kill a Mockingbird has sold more than 40 million copies. Flynt's Mockingbird Songs: My Friendship With Harper Lee will be released May 2."
"Saturday Night Live got off to a slow start this weekend, but Aidy Bryant’s performance as Sarah Huckabee Sanders singlehandedly saved the day. Cutting abruptly from a formal setting to an elaborately choreographed musical number is as a close to a surefire laugh as there is, but Bryant really sells this, singing and dancing her way through Demi Lovato’s “Confident” like Sean Spicer wants his old job back. What’s more, her impression of the press secretary—which started as just an accent and a joke about her mother being “a big southern hamburger” —is starting to capture the blithe obliviousness that is Sanders’ stock in trade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the sketch also shows an admirable commitment to going further for a laugh than status-quo Donald Trump sketches, which often do rely on the fact that Trump’s incompetence and stupidity should be funny enough on their own. (They’re not, at least not anymore.) Saturday Night Live’s best political work of late—“Through Donald Trump’s Eyes,” “Kellywise”—is the stuff that acknowledges up front that we’re living a nightmare, then uses the language and logic of bad dreams to respond. This sketch reminds us that every nightmare—even the one about the press secretary who blithely insults the entire country’s intelligence on a daily basis—is somebody else’s dream.  Larry David’s monologue on this weekend’s Saturday Night Live was pretty, pretty, pretty — well, not great, according to some people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Curb Your Enthusiasm star ended his opening words with a run of jokes that left a poor taste in many viewers’ mouths: “I’ve always been obsessed with women, and I’ve often wondered: If I’d grown up in Poland when Hitler came to power and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp?” he started before imagining what kind of conversation he’d have with another guy as they figured out how to flirt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The problem is, there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp,” he continued, then proposed some: “‘How’s it going? They treatin’ you okay? You know, if we ever get out of here, I’d love to take you out for some latkes. You like latkes?’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although many Twitter users were not fans of David’s bit, some defended it: “Larry David may be the most important Jewish comedian ever,” user Barret tweeted. “He’s allowed to make concentration camp jokes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See Twitter’s less positive reactions to the joke below, and stay tuned for EW’s full recap on the night’s episode, hosted by David and featuring musical guest Miley Cyrus.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kicking the episode off in classic SNL fashion, Alec Baldwin reprised his role as Trump – the real-life version of whom is on his first trip to Asia as president, the late night version of whom snuck off to check on his old buddy Manafort (Alex Moffat) after his no good very bad week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But don’t worry. Melania is happy with the (very) fake lookalike Baldwin’s Trump sent along in his stead. In fact, she’s falling in love! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To make absolutely sure Manafort isn’t wearing a wire, Trump insisted the pair pop in the shower together, as one does. He even got in a shot at the Hollywood scandal du jour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What an idiot that Harvey Weinstein is; he could’ve gotten away with all of it if only he’d gotten himself elected president,” Baldwin said to a chorus of audience groans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And not just a regular naked shower with the sitting president of the United States either! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This one had special guests: Vice President Mike Pence (Beck Bennett) and everyone’s favorite Keebler elf, Attorney General Jeff Sessions (Kate McKinnon). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m wearing a bathing costume that I got from my favorite place – the 1890s,” McKinnon said in her practiced Sessionsian drawl. “Plus I thought we should get all used to wearing stripes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trio of executive authority, or perhaps, the SNL writers, ultimately determined the best course of action to save a Manafort who seems destined for prison would involve a presidential turkey pardon. Unless, of course, the Trump family accidentally eats him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A man can dream.","Saturday Night Live covered a lot of ground in its most recent episode, from President Trump and Paul Manafort naked together in the shower to Larry David making ill-received concentration camp jokes.

Joining them are Kate McKinnon as Jeff Sessions (""I’m wearing a bathing costume that I got from my favorite place—the 1890s,"" she drawls.

"One staple of a Michele Bachmann campaign event is blaring Elvis Presley music. Another is a reference to her intent to make Barack Obama a one-term president. Increasingly, there is a third feature of a Bachmann appearance on the presidential trail: a staffer’s physical confrontation with a reporter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In less than two months since entering the 2012 race, Bachmann’s campaign staff has become embroiled in at least five unusually hostile encounters with the traveling media marked by pushing, shoving and, in one instance, the allegation of a threat of violence to a reporter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Text Size - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR + NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reset Allen on Bachmann security POLITICO 44 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of it has unfolded in full public view: Bachmann aides’ tussles with the press have twice turned into news stories, once when veteran ABC News reporter Brian Ross was shoved and pushed by Bachmann staffers in South Carolina and on a second occasion when Bachmann’s husband and two staffers pushed CNN’s Don Lemon into a cart, producing a furious on-air complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another incident that did not make the air, a camera captured Fox News correspondent Steve Brown telling a bodyguard in Iowa, “Do not put your hands on me. Don’t ever do it again.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A foreign reporter also alleged to POLITICO this week that an aide threatened to break his arm — an allegation the Bachmann campaign denied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friction between the press and high-profile politicians and celebrities is nothing new. But the number and intensity of incidents is unusual, particularly in Iowa, where reporters and the public are accustomed to almost unlimited access as an early state presidential ritual. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The campaign makes no apologies for its physically aggressive approach to media management, asserting that it is simply doing what it has to do to protect a popular, controversial candidate. The most aggressive aide — a tall, silver-haired man according to reporters — a spokeswoman said, is a former Secret Service agent who has guarded presidents. He and an advance woman frequently make physical contact with reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The No. 1 priority for us every single day we step out on the campaign trail is the safety and security of Michele Bachmann,” said her spokeswoman, Alice Stewart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The retired Secret Service agent, whom she declined to name, is “extremely professional.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He’s guarded presidents and vice presidents and knows exactly what needs to be done,” she said. “When he gives a warning to whoever it may be, the person needs to heed the warning.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The conduct seems authentically motivated by security concerns for the popular grass-roots candidate, who tends to draw enthusiastic crowds. But the Minnesota congresswoman isn’t the first celebrity-like figure to run for president, or the biggest. And the contentious encounters with the press has far oustripped that of other high-profile campaigns. Security guards for high-profile candidates like Rudy Giuliani, Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin were better able to distinguish between reporters and threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The difference was sharply visible over the past week at the Iowa State Fair. Palin wandered the fairgrounds freely with her husband, an advance man, and, at a remove, a handful of Iowa State Police. Rick Perry was guarded by watchful Texas Rangers who gave the press and fair-goers broad latitude to talk and walk next to the governor. Bachmann, in contrast, raced through the fair in a golf cart; in a similar cart in Ames on Saturday, her bodyguard could be seen pushing away the hands of autograph-seeking supporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reporter alleging that a warning crossed over into a threat is a Norwegian correspondent, Are Tagvold Flaten, who is in Iowa on a grant from the Oslo-based Freedom of Expression Foundation. He is covering the race for a Norwegian website about American politics and also wrote about the Ames Straw Poll for the conservative Norwegian Web journal Minerva (recently in the news for its editor’s pained consideration of the fact that the mass murderer Anders Breivik was among the site’s commenters).  Kathy Griffin has, over the past few years, been a persistent thorn in the side of the Palin family, pulling public stunts, taking out Levi Johnston to events and making jokes about Sarah and Bristol a regular part of her stand-up repertoire. Now, with a new religious ultraconservative woman taking the spotlight, the comedienne has a new target in her sights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Appearing on ""Conan"" Monday night, Griffin recalled the time she met Bachmann in Washington while researching for her rally to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps mistaking Griffin for someone else, one of Bachmann's staffers pulled out a video camera to capture their interaction for her website. First, Griffin says she asked the Congresswoman if she'd support an effort to repeal the law that banned homosexuals from the military. When Bachmann declined, Griffin got personal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Congresswoman Bachmann, were you born a bigot or did you, like, grow into it?"" she asked -- on tape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for Bachmann's answer? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""That's a good question. I'm gonna have to get back to ya,"" she said, perhaps not creating the best of campaign slogans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WATCH:","Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign is brash and boisterous—and increasingly rough with the reporters covering it, reports Politico. In less than two months, there have been at least five incidents reporters have called unusually hostile, including a Norwegian reporter who says an aide threatened to break his arm. Bachmann's campaign says security is just doing what it needs to keep their candidate safe, but veteran reporters say her security is going too far, well beyond the norms for bigger and more controversial candidates' security. Bachmann's spokeswoman defended one guard, a retired Secret Service agent, who has particularly come under criticism for his rough style. “He’s guarded presidents and vice presidents and knows exactly what needs to be done,” she said. “When he gives a warning to whoever it may be, the person needs to heed the warning.” On the other hand, with celebrities calling Bachmann a ""bigot"" to her face—as Kathy Griffin recounted on her Monday appearance on Conan—perhaps her security feels the need to stand up for their candidate."

Only five are in negative territory, led by California (27% favorable and 44% unfavorable), Illinois (19-29), New Jersey (25-32), Mississippi (22-28), and Utah (24-27). Only seven other states have net-positive ratings in the single digits, and another breaks even (Louisiana). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 54% see Hawaii positively and only 10% negatively, followed in the top ten by Colorado (44-9), Tennessee (48-14), South Dakota (42-8), Virginia (45-13), Montana (39-7), Alaska (46-17), Oregon (43-14), and North Carolina and Pennsylvania (each 40-11). Ten others are in positive territory by at least 21 points. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are also some differences across demographic lines. Women have a higher opinion of New York by 27 points more than men, Massachusetts by 22 points, Delaware and California by 16, New Hampshire by 15, Vermont and Illinois by 13, and Connecticut by 11, while men see North Dakota more favorably by 17 points, South Carolina by 15, Wyoming 14, Montana 13, and Iowa and South Dakota 10. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats’ favorite states include Hawaii (62-7), Washington (50-10), Massachusetts (49-9), Oregon (46-6), Vermont (46-9), Colorado (45-8), and New York (51-15), and their least favorites are led by Texas (17-51), Alabama (13-45), and Mississippi (13-41). Republicans love Alaska (65-3) and Texas (66-9), and absolutely hate California (12-68), followed distantly by Illinois (15-44) and Massachusetts (19-47). So the greatest partisan gap is for California, which Democrats like 91 points more than Republicans do, followed by Texas, which is favored more by Republicans by 82 points. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Black voters dislike 10 of the 14 Southern states. The only ones they like are North Carolina (their second favorite overall after Hawaii, at 42-8), Virginia (36-13), Tennessee (36-15), Maryland (32-13), and Florida (34-18). Their least favorite state overall is Alabama (14-56), then Mississippi (15-51), and Texas (17-44). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Full results here  Texas is big, proud and … not really liked that much by people in other states, at least according to the results of a Public Policy Polling survey released Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The state of Texas is many things, but when 1,200 Americans were asked for their opinion of Texas in the last several months, 31 percent responded unfavorably. The good news is that 40 percent responded favorably, but the difference in percentages wasn’t enough for the state to be viewed more positively than Hawaii. Or North Dakota. Or Rhode Island. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You get the idea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 9 percentage point difference in positive and negative opinions placed Texas at 38th most liked state among the 50 United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But however Texas is viewed, residents can take comfort in knowing Americans aren’t indifferent about its Lone Star. About forty to sixty percent of respondents answered “not sure” when asked about their opinions of most states. But only 29 percent were unsure whether they liked Texas or not – a credit to Texas’s distinct culture and style, said Mark P. Jones, chair of the Department of Political Science at Rice University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “States like Texas, given that it’s a well known brand and elicits a lot of positive support, it also has high negatives,” Jones said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only state respondents had less of an opinion about was California with 28 percent – the most hated state on the list. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some more findings from the survey: If you are black, you probably don’t like Texas as much as most other states, but it’s better than Mississippi or Alabama. If you are a Republican, you probably love Texas and hate California. (The reverse is true if you are a Democrat.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Take heart, Texas – 25 million people can’t be wrong. You will always be the biggest (as long as you’re only counting the continental states because Alaska beats you by a lot.) You have a lot of oil and presidents and a really big water park. And people like you more than New Jersey.","Americans are generally pretty positive, or at least indifferent, about these United States. Public Policy Polling asked 1,200 people how they felt about each of the 50 states, and only five were viewed more unfavorably than favorably. America's favorite state, by an overwhelming margin was Hawaii, while its least favorite was California. Here are the top and bottom five, along with their favorable/unfavorable split: Most popular: Hawaii—54-10 (+44) Colorado—44-9 (+35) Tennessee—48-14 (+34) South Dakota—42-8 (+34) Virginia—45-13 (+32) Least popular: California—27-44 (-17) Illinois—19-29 (-10) New Jersey—25-32 (-7) Mississippi—22-28 (-6) Utah—24-27 (-3) Of course, most people are indifferent about most states, the Houston Chronicle observes, with an average of two-thirds of respondents saying they were ""not sure"" for each. But some states were quite polarizing; Democrats like California 91 points more than Republicans do, while Republicans like Texas 82 points more than Democrats."

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The deal, in an all-cash offer, is expected to be announced imminently, sources said. If completed the acquisition would be the most significant in the history of YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006 for $1.65 billion.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR YouTube is preparing for U.S. regulators to challenge the Twitch deal, according to sources. YouTube is far and away the No. 1 platform for Internet video, serving more than 6 billion hours of video per month to 1 billion users worldwide, and the company expects the Justice Department to take a hard look at whether buying Twitch raises anticompetitive issues in the online-video market.

If you're not nerdy enough to know, Twitch is a popular destination for video game fans, where top players (or anyone, really) stream video of their play sessions. The company boasts that it has more than 45 million monthly users, more than 1 million of whom stream content. During one week in April, it accounted for 44% of all US streaming traffic, according to Qwilt. Just how close the deal is to done is unclear; Variety says it ""is expected to be announced imminently,"" but the Wall Street Journal characterizes talks as ""at an early stage."" YouTube is bracing for anti-trust objections, given how large its lead already is in the online video space. The Google unit has more than 1 billion monthly users, but its streaming service, YouTube Live, actually lags behind Twitch.

"With this petition, and the efforts of several other people on the internet, we were able to convince Disney to issue an epilepsy warning for Incredibles 2! Now we're moving on to our next goal: to have them include an epilepsy warning in the Blu-Ray release of the film. This can set a precedent to make movies (both in the theater and at home) safer for all viewers.  More from USA Today: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even Sophia Bush has a 'lady crush' on Voyd, her breakout 'Incredibles 2' hero NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Incredibles 2' soars with $180M: Biggest opening ever for an animated film NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The definitive ranking of all 20 Pixar movies (including 'Incredibles 2') NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AMC supervisor Mauricio Mencia, who's worked at the Universal CityWalk location in Los Angeles for the past year, says, ""I've never seen something like that happen."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The memo, which has been shared on social media, says: "" 'Incredibles 2' contains a sequence of flashing lights, which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mencia's theater has informed the staff about the memo and posted the warning next to the guest greeter who rips tickets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Epilepsy Foundation, ""for about 3 percent of people with epilepsy, exposure to flashing lights at certain intensities, or with certain visual patterns, can trigger seizures. This condition is known as photosensitive epilepsy and it's more common in children and adolescents, especially those with generalized epilepsy and a type known as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jackie Aker, director of media relations for the Epilepsy Foundation, says her organization had never before called for a movie to issue a photosensitivity warning, but earlier this year asked Apple to change a promotional spot for the new iPad that had flashing lights that would be unsafe for certain viewers. Apple worked with the foundation to change the video. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1997, an episode of ""Pokémon"" that aired in Japan with flashing lights sent nearly 700 children to the hospital.  This is not a joke. I was at a first-night showing tonight, and my immediate thought was how disasterously unsafe this movie is for my photosensitive epilepic friends. @markingatlightspeed I’m tagging you with this specifically because I feel that this would be extremely dangerous for you to watch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are multiple scenes in this movie with full-screen, black-and-white flashing strobe effects. They all happen without warning, and last anywhere between a few seconds to more than two minutes. In a darkened movie theater, this means the likelihood of a seizure could be VERY HIGH if you are sensitive to these effects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you have photosensitive epilepsy or another disorder that is triggered by strobe lights, I would highly recommend you DO NOT SEE THE INCREDIBLES 2 IN THEATERS. Wait until the movie’s released on digital/Bluray, and you can watch it in a fully-lit room, with someone with you who will be able to help if the strobe effects do trigger a seizure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Please stay safe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATE: After talking to some people who have loved ones with severe epilepsy, I would sadly have to recommend that you DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE - PERIOD - IF YOU HAVE SEVERE SEIZURES WHEN EXPOSED TO STROBE EFFECTS. DO NOT PUT YOUR HEALTH AT RISK FOR A MOVIE. NO KIND OF MEDIA IS WORTH GAMBLING WITH YOUR LIFE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scenes in which the flashing happens are MAJOR plot points and CANNOT be skipped. The one workaround I can suggest would be to find a version of the movie (when it’s released) with Audio Descriptions for the visually impaired. Watch it on your PC - turn the monitor OFF, but keep the audio going. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you have been disappointed by the creative decisions made by Disney-Pixar, please sign the petition created by @moviehealthcommunity for Disney to include a seizure warning for moviegoers and people who buy/rent the movie. It is unlikely they would edit these things out of the movie entirely - but there are nearly 20,000 notes on this post, and if 20,000 people asked them to consider people with epilepsy, it could mean they consider these things more carefully in the future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thank you.","After anecdotal warnings circulated on social media, Disney has issued an official seizure warning for Incredibles 2. Both the film and the trailer contain flashing or strobe light effects, which can cause seizures for some epileptic viewers; the Epilepsy Foundation spoke out about the issue, and a petition called for Disney to include a visual warning about the lights. On Friday, Disney asked theaters showing the movie to include such a warning, reports CNBC, which calls it an ""unprecedented"" move by the company. The lights can also affect people who suffer from migraines or have other conditions causing them to be photosensitive. Disney's official memo reads, ""Incredibles 2 contains a sequence of flashing lights, which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities."""

Parker is in the middle of a $50 million contract with the Spurs.As for whether Chris Brown or Drake will be added as defendants, Parker's lawyer,, tells TMZ ... he's waiting for the results of the police investigation. He also wants to review the surveillance tape before making his decision.  This wasn’t the kind of bottle service NBA star Tony Parker had in mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The San Antonio Spurs guard (pictured) — injured in the Chris Brown-Drake melee at a SoHo nightclub — filed a $20 million lawsuit against its owners yesterday, saying they should have known better than to let the Rihanna love rivals in at the same time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, Parker holds W.i.P.’s owners responsible for the “corneal laceration of the left eye and other injuries” he suffered in the bottle-throwing brawl at the now-shuttered Vandam Street club. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His lawyer, David Jaroslawicz, said the extent of Parker’s wounds aren’t yet known, but noted eye injuries “certainly don’t improve your outside shot.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit does not name Brown or Drake, who have both dated Rihanna, as defendants, but blames the club for creating the combustible combination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She’s been known, like Helen of Troy, to cause trouble,” Jaroslawicz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sources said Drake, 25, sent Brown, 23, into a rage when his table sent over a note that read, “I am f–king the love of your life.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown had just bought the hip-hop star a pricey bottle of champagne, sources said. Drake’s camp maintains the fight was instigated by a member of Brown’s crew. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jaroslawicz said it’s the club’s fault. By selling both camps bottle service, “you’re throwing gasoline on the flames,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suit says Parker, 30, ex-hubby of actress Eva Longoria, wasn’t sitting with either camp. But he has said he was “with my friend Chris Brown” when the problems started. “They started throwing bottles everywhere,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parker, slated to play with the French team at the Summer Olympics, said he’ll be sidelined for a week as he heals with the aid of a “therapeutic” contact lens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ll be missing the start of the French team because I can’t do anything for a week except keep the lens in and then take drops,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A representative for the club declined to comment.","The fallout from Chris Brown's throwdown with Drake's entourage continues: Now Tony Parker is suing the New York City nightclub where it happened for a cool $20 million. The NBA star says the club, WiP, should have known that allowing Brown and Drake—who've both been involved with Rihanna—in at the same time was a terrible idea. Thus, the lawsuit claims, the club owners are responsible for the injuries he suffered in the fight. Those injuries include a ""corneal laceration of the left eye,"" the lawsuit claims, and Parker's lawyer notes that eye injuries ""certainly don't improve your outside shot."" The lawyer also, amusingly, says of Rihanna: ""She’s been known, like Helen of Troy, to cause trouble.""

"The younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge has been the subject of a fierce bidding war by some of Britain’s largest publishers for her first book. It is understood that publisher Michael Joseph, an imprint of Penguin books, last week signed her up to a publishing deal worth £400,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to industry sources, the negotiating process involved delicate discussions about the book’s timing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms Middleton will wait for the launch of her first book until after the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations next summer so that she is not seen to be cashing in on her royal connections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She is keen for the book to be released next year but is determined that she is not seen to be making money from her closeness to the royal family. Therefore the book is likely to be launched late next autumn, after the summer celebrations around the Queen’s Jubilee but in time for the Christmas market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She wanted to publish it next year, but it will be timed to come out after the Jubilee,” said one book industry insider. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book will be a guide to being the perfect party hostess. It will include recipes, anecdotes and details of how to throw a range of different types of event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fact that Ms Middleton’s agent David Godwin, whose DGA company also represents Vikram Seth and William Dalrymple, has secured such a high six-figure advance shows that the industry is expecting high sales. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It is a massive amount of money, particularly in the current environment,” said one agent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to its website, Michael Joseph publishes “highly commercial, popular fiction and non-fiction, principally interested in publishing Top Ten bestsellers”. Other authors on its roster include Jamie Oliver, Jeremy Clarkson and Ant and Dec. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Publishers who were also keen on the book are thought to include Harper Collins and Cornerstone, a branch of Random House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms Middleton has toured around different publishing houses pitching the book over the last few months. Book executives said that she went down a storm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Publishers believe that her experience as a professional party-planner at Table Talk, a London-based company, and her regular contributions to The Party Times, the online newsletter of her parent’s Party Pieces firm, make her perfectly positioned to write an authoritative book. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesman for Michael Joseph was unavailable for comment.  Pippa Middleton's butt is in trouble. Don't worry, not her actual buttocks, but you know figuratively speaking, Pippa's ass is on the line. After word got around that the world's most famous little sister (take that Ashlee, Ali, and Solange) was getting $1.5 million to pen a book about party planning and etiquette, people were kind of pissed off. The Telegraph reports that Pips' been in talks with publishers for a while now and that things are getting serious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ""Pippa factor"" may have sold a few handbags and launched a few fan blogs, but this party planning book may be the one thing that could burst that bubble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's not like she planned the royal wedding, after all. And etiquette, hmm. Wasn't she photographed dancing with a dude in her bra with bottles of booze in the background? Sounds fun, but ... that doesn't really necessarily display the characteristics of someone who's a supposed expert on manners, decorum, and propriety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her family owns a party supplies business so Pippa is no stranger to the game, but to say that Kate has nothing to do with this humongous book deal would be a bit unfair. There are plenty of successful, well-known party planners in this world who could actually share tried and true tips on throwing the best fete, but Pippa isn't one of them. She's a perma-tanned beauty and pseudo-royal who's in the spotlight because of her relatives, not because of her expertise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I'm not the only one who thinks this is a bad idea; not many people are fans of Pippa's alleged contract. The U.K. economy is not that great and to hand over money for a fluff piece written by someone related to Kate Middleton is ticking off a lot of Britons. And I'd have to agree that it's midly perturbing. Pippa seems like a smart, beautiful and resourceful woman -- she doesn't need anything handed to her. Kate's coattails probably look like a lot of fun to ride, but she shouldn't hop on just because it's easy. Pippa seems better than that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Do you think Pippa should write a party planning book? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo via Splash News","When do you get paid six figures to write a party planning book? When you’re Pippa Middleton, of course. Her Royal Hotness has officially signed a book deal worth more than $620,000 to write the guide, which will be out by next Christmas, the Telegraph reports. She was originally rumored to be in talks for a deal worth more than twice that amount, which, of course, led to some uproar. Hilariously, the Telegraph notes that Middleton’s book will be released after the Queen’s summertime Diamond Jubilee celebration so that Pippa “is not seen to be cashing in on her royal connections.” To be fair, she does have professional party planning experience, and she regularly contributes to her parents’ online party planning newsletter. That would totally get most normal people a book deal! The guide will reportedly include recipes and stories, as well as instructions for hosting many different events."

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A fourth otter carcass was discovered on 20 August with a suspected gunshot wound, Ashley Spratt of the Fish and Wildlife Service said on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Finding several gunshot sea otters at the same general location during such a short time frame is very unusual,” said Spratt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We don’t know why these otters were shot, but what’s important to note is that killing or harassing federally protected wildlife is a crime.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sea otters are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, California state law and the Endangered Species Act. Killing a sea otter is punishable by fines up to $100,000 and could result in a jail sentence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sea otters were once widespread along the Pacific coast, but the mammals were hunted almost to extinction for their pelts during the 18th and 19th centuries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1977, California’s remaining sea otters were listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They’re a keystone species. They help play a role in the broader ecosystem,” said Spratt. “So with the loss of these sea otters, we also have the loss of their benefit to the ecosystem.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wildlife officials urge people to stop painting endangered turtle shells Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today sea otters are primarily threatened by oil spills and coastal tanker traffic, Spratt said, although otter killings by humans are not unheard of. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In September 2013, three dead otters were found near Asilomar state beach, an unsolved crime that Spratt said is now considered a “cold case”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The otter carcasses have been transported to the US Fish and Wildlife forensic lab in Oregon, where they are undergoing necropsies.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Park rangers are offering a $10,000 reward to get their hands on whoever shot and killed three endangered southern sea otters in the Santa Cruz area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two of the slain animals washed up on beaches in Santa Cruz and a third in nearby Aptos about two weeks ago, according to Max Schad, a wildlife officer with the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. A fourth dead otter washed up at Natural Bridges State Beach in Santa Cruz, but rangers were unable to determine, because of its deteriorated condition, whether it had been shot. All of the animals were males. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal veterinarians said the animals had been shot from several days to several weeks before their bodies were found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Southern sea otters, also known as California sea otters, once were plentiful along the Pacific coast from Mexico to Washington. They now number around 3,000 and are confined to the area between San Mateo and Santa Barbara counties. Heavy hunting during the 19th century nearly wiped out the species. They were declared threatened in 1977. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Killing a southern sea otter is punishable with a $100,000 fine and a jail sentence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anyone with information on the shootings should call the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at (650) 876-9078.

Authorities have found in just a matter of days four male sea otters washed ashore, though the fourth body was so deteriorated it's not yet been determined whether it was also shot, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The endangered furry marine mammals are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, California state law, and the Endangered Species Act, and the killer could face fines up to $100,000 and jail time.

"Several people in Bennington say they've been attacked by a squirrel over the last few weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kevin McDonald tells the Bennington Banner he was shoveling snow when the squirrel jumped onto him. He says he threw the animal off, but it twice jumped back onto him. A game warden says there have been other reports, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One woman is being treated for exposure to rabies, but Vermont Public Health Veterinarian Robert Johnson says there's never been a case of a squirrel passing rabies to a human. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson says it's possible the squirrel was raised as a pet and lost its fear of humans. He says the squirrel might ""go ballistic"" when it encounters people it doesn't recognize.  Tuesday March 15, 2011 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BENNINGTON -- An East Street man said he was minding his own business and shoveling snow away from the side of his house when he was attacked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""All of a sudden I felt something on my back and shoulders, scratching,"" said Kevin McDonald, of 15 East St. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a gray squirrel, said McDonald. He threw the animal off, but twice it jumped back onto his arms, delivering more scratches. Finally, it ran up a tree and McDonald retreated to his house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The first thing that goes through your mind is ‘is it rabid?’"" he said. After doing some research into the matter on the Internet, McDonald said he learned bites are the real concern with rabies infection, and squirrel attacks are quite rare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Which is why he was surprised the next day, when his wife reported hearing yelling from across the street. He said he looked to see his neighbor with a blanket and a metal pole battling a gray squirrel not unlike the one that attacked him the day before. Later, he would learn that a woman on the same street had also been attacked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the incident is on the amusing side of the spectrum for him, McDonald said it was a bit eerie to have the squirrel not only jump him, but jump back onto him after being thrown off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I thought it was funny until I learned of two other people being attacked; then I thought it should be taken a little more seriously,"" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local Game Warden Travis Buttle said he’s spoken to two NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR people on East Street, but not McDonald, about the attacking squirrel. He said one woman was bitten on the back of the neck, and under advice of her doctor is undergoing a rabies vaccination series. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said there isn’t much he can do unless someone manages to contain the squirrel, say in a garage or a shed. To test for rabies the animal has to be captured and destroyed. Buttle advised anyone attacked by a squirrel, or any animal, to talk to their doctor and follow the advice given. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the squirrel was rabid, Buttle said, it would likely have died of the disease by now. The disease, which affects the brains of mammals, causes them to behave oddly and in some cases aggressively. Buttle said that normally he would try to track an animal suspected of rabies, but when he got the calls on the squirrel he was two hours away and the victims reported the animal had disappeared almost immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Buttle said these cases are unusual because the attacks appear to be unprovoked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR","A rogue gray squirrel has been terrorizing a neighborhood in Vermont. One resident says he was shoveling snow when the squirrel jumped onto his back three separate times, scratching and clawing him before he finally managed to chase it away.

One victim is being treated for exposure to rabies, although Vermont's chief veterinarian says there's never been a case of a squirrel passing rabies to a human. He says that it's likely that the squirrel isn't rabid, but may have been kept as a pet and lost its fear of humans.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A federal judge in St. Louis ruled yesterday that Carl and Janice Duffner can be forced to plant turf grass in their yard — even though Janice Duffner has severe grass allergies.If the Duffners fail to plant the grass, under the ruling, the city of St. Peters can sock them with fines that have potentially grown to well over $200,000 — or even have them sent to prison for several decades.David Roland of the Freedom Center of Missouri, who is representing the Duffners, said the ordinance is so absurd, and the possible punishments so over-the-top, the case could ultimately end up with the U.S. Supreme Court.Suffice it to say, he's appealing.""It is so outrageous,"" he says. ""This is a couple with health problems facing gross penalties for what they've chosen not to plant on their personal property. If ever there was a circumstance where the court should intervene, it would be these facts.""St. Peters passed an ordinance in the last decade requiring that homeowners cover at least 50 percent of their yard areas with turf grass. And that was a problem for the Duffners, who've owned their home in the well-heeled St. Louis suburb since 2002 — and, upon moving in, had planted a lush flower garden that contains no turf grass, thought it does have other ground cover.In May 2014, the Duffners got a letter from the city saying their yard was not in compliance. The couple applied for a variance, and in July 2014, they were granted one.However, it didn't give them a free pass; it still required them to plant at least five percent turf grass. Absent that, the St. Peters ordinances suggested, they would face fines of at least $10 a day, and potentially much, much more.The couple refused — and, that September, filed a lawsuit.The litigation has taken a long and torturous route. After the Duffners filed in state court, an adverse ruling sent them to appeals court, where they earned a partial victory. But the ruling sent the case back to the lower court. The Duffners chose to instead file in federal court in 2016.Yesterday, U.S. District Court Judge John A. Ross issued a ruling that was mostly in favor of the city. He found that even if the facts as presented by the Duffners were true, it wasn't enough to win the case. And with that, he granted summary judgment for St. Peters.Roland says there are some strategic benefits to Ross' decision, and said he's glad to have clarity, more than a year after St. Peters moved for summary judgment.But, he says, the decision cannot be allowed to stand.""My estimation is that this is one of the most important property rights cases in the country right now,"" he says, suggesting that advocacy groups that care about property rights will likely choose to join the Duffners' fight. ""We're going to go all hands on deck.""Rather than prohibiting certain plants that might be harmful, Roland notes, St. Peters' ordinance instead forces homeowners to proactively plant others. ""It's a huge leap conceptually, and that's why it's so dangerous,"" he says. ""By this principle, a city could require you to put in a swimming pool and pay to maintain it. That's the same thing we're talking about here.""He adds, ""The courts have long found that people have the right to use their personal property in a lawful, harmless way — and have the right to exclude things from their property they don't want there.""  Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.","Janice Duffner is allergic to grass, so she and her husband, Carl, have no lawn—only flowers are planted in their Missouri yard, which also includes ponds and pathways. They bought their St. Peters home in 2002, and in 2008, the Board of Aldermen adopted a city ordinance requiring 50% of residents' yards to be made up of grass turf. Someone eventually filed a complaint about the Duffners' yard; the couple requested an exemption, but it was denied. In 2014, they were granted a variance, but were still required to plant grass on at least 5% of their property. After various court and administrative battles, in 2016, the Duffners filed a civil rights action in federal court, saying they faced up to $180,000 in penalties and 20 years in jail for their refusal to comply. Last week, a federal judge ruled in favor of the city, the Kansas City Star reports. US District Judge John A. Ross ruled that the Duffners ""have failed to identify a fundamental right that is restricted by the Turf Grass Ordinance,"" have failed to show that the penalties for noncompliance with the ordinance are excessive, and that the Supreme Court has held that ""aesthetic considerations constitute a legitimate government purpose."" He also said the complaint was too general and if a court accepted it, it could place ""many, if not all"" such zoning laws under scrutiny, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The couple's lawyer, who says ""this is one of the most important property rights cases in the country right now,"" says the couple will appeal. He tells the Riverfront Times the case could go to the Supreme Court. ""This is a couple with health problems facing gross penalties for what they've chosen not to plant on their personal property."""

After two days of climbing, the climbers were approximately 1,000 feet below the summit. In mid-afternoon, the lead climber sustained a fall that was not life threatening. However, during the fall, a secondary rope became wrapped around his right thumb, severing the appendage clean from the hand. The severed thumb miraculously fell approximately 80 feet and landed on a two foot by one foot ledge. The climbing partner was able to retrieve the thumb and the pair called the Yosemite National Park Emergency Communication Center seeking emergency assistance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At 3:50 p.m., the park's contract helicopter, piloted by Richard Shatto, along with Helitec Crewmembers Jeff Pirog and Eric Small, and Yosemite Park Rangers Jeff Webb and Dave Pope, flew from Yosemite Valley to assess the situation. Although the weather was favorable with light winds, impending darkness was an issue and Incident Commander, Yosemite Valley District Ranger Eric Gabriel, made the decision to attempt to extract the climber via short-haul. This is a technique where Park Rangers are suspended from a rope below the helicopter to remove the climber from the wall. Gabriel, who had consulted with the park's medical clinic, knew of the short window of time in which the thumb could successfully be reattached and felt the complex mission was worth pursuing. The helicopter hovered near the climbers and Park Rangers Webb and Pope were successfully short-hauled to the injured party. Once on the wall, the injured climber was transported back to El Capitan Meadow via helicopter. On the ground, the climber was transferred to another air medical helicopter to be flown out of the park. Webb remained with the partner overnight and was raised approximately 1,000 feet the following day to the summit using traditional rock-rescue technique.

Murkowski's gay marriage views 'evolving' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By BY MATT TUNSETH/Chugiak-Eagle River Star NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowsk (R-Alaska) talks to a constituent before entering the Bear Mountain Grill in Eagle River on Wednesday, March 27 in Eagle River, where she addressed the Chugiak-Eagle River Chamber of Commerce. Star photo by Matt Tunseth NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski said Wednesday that her views on gay marriage are ""evolving"" and that she's reviewing her stance on the issue ""very closely."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I think it's important to acknowledge that there is a change afoot in this country in terms of how marriage is viewed,"" said Alaska's senior senator, who has in the past voted to support proposed constitutional amendments defining marriage as between one man and one woman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murkowski's comments came following an address to the Chugiak-Eagle River Chamber of Commerce in which she touched on a variety of topics, including sequestration, the Senate's recently-passed budget and her efforts to end partisan gridlock in Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked about same sex marriage — which is currently being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in two separate cases — Murkowski seemed to indicate a softening on her previous stance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I've got two young sons who, when I ask them and their friends how they feel about gay marriage, kinda give me one of those looks like, 'Gosh mom, why are you even asking that question?'"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When pressed to come out either for or against gay marriage, Murkwoski said her view is ""evolving."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The term 'evolving view' has been perhaps overused, but I think it is an appropriate term for me to use,"" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murkowski said her position may depend on what she hears from her consitutents in Alaska, who in 1998 passed an amendment to the state constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It may be that Alaska will come to revisit its position on gay marriage, and as a policy maker I am certainly revieiwing that very closely,"" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) has come out in favor of gay marriage, while Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska) has said he's against it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murkowski said the the nation faces far bigger issues than who should be allowed to get married. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We have so many issues in this country to focus on that worry us, that I question why there is such focus on the simple right of people to love whom they will,"" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For a complete report on Murkowski's address to the chamber, see the April 4 edition of the Star.","Plenty of Senate Democrats have announced their support of gay marriage in recent weeks, but so far only Rob Portman has done so on the Republican side. That might soon change: Alaska's Lisa Murkowski tells the Chugiak-Eagle River Star that her view is ""evolving."" Murkowski has voted in the past to define marriage as a union of man and woman, notes Politico, but like many of the other politicians having second thoughts, she cites the influence of her kids: ""I've got two young sons who, when I ask them and their friends how they feel about gay marriage, kinda give me one of those looks like, 'Gosh mom, why are you even asking that question?'"" She says she's still not ready to declare a flip in position, however.

"Officer Lameen Barnes prepared the official incident report that night on what happened to Mr. Dixon, writing that he had tried to throw an “unknown liquid substance” at the officers, and in response, they had searched his cell for contraband. When they entered, the report said, Mr. Dixon refused to come out, insulted them and would not follow their orders. He was restrained and handcuffed to a gurney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Once on his feet, inmate Dixon was eventually escorted to the main clinic for medical examination without any further incident of force used,” Mr. Barnes wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That is nothing like what actually happened, according to accounts from three people who were there. Two requested anonymity because they said they feared retaliation from officers as well as their employer, Corizon, which has a contract with the city to provide health care at the jail. For the third witness, The Times was provided a copy of the clinician’s email to superiors about the incident, on the condition that the sender’s name be withheld. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to their accounts, a group of correction officers wheeled Mr. Dixon into an examination area without a security camera. “Don’t leave me,” he kept yelling to the medics and social workers. “They’re going to kill me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About a half-dozen guards were crowded around the gurney, and one kept punching Mr. Dixon in the head. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next, the correction officers brought in Mr. Lane, who had also splashed guards with a liquid. Mr. Lane was known as a disruptive inmate. He had been in and out of Rikers, and much of his most recent stint had been spent in solitary confinement. Born to a mother who was a crack addict, he spent most of his time growing up in foster homes and had a lengthy history of mental health problems, with diagnoses for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and attention deficit disorder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They punched me in the face and they kept punching me and punching me and punching me,” Mr. Lane recalled in an interview at Elmira Correctional Facility, where he recently completed a two-year sentence for a credit card theft conviction.  NEW YORK (AP) — The newly appointed commissioner of New York City's jail system violated city law by sending as many as 47 mentally ill inmates into 23-hour confinement without first getting approval from mental health clinicians, a city oversight board said Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Commissioner Joseph Ponte, who took the helm of the country's second-largest jail system in March, insisted at a meeting of the New York City Board of Correction he was trying to quell rising levels of violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ponte, who had reduced the use of solitary confinement by two thirds in Maine's state prisons, said the June 13 move on Rikers Island was aimed at volatile inmates who have broken jailhouse rules and owe days in solitary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But board members rejected the argument, noting the move jeopardized the health of some inmates, particularly those on psychotropic medications who were taken from air-conditioned mental observation units and put into uncooled solitary cells. A federal judge has ordered that such inmates, deemed heat-sensitive because the exposure to heat while on such drugs can be fatal, shouldn't be placed in uncooled cells. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other inmates who were moved were denied medication and had seizure disorders, they said. At least one inmate suffered a seizure, Ponte said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I would just hope that you would review these issues and in the future instruct your staff to be consistent with the board standards and not to violate these rules which are not just rules but designed for the safety of the prisoners,"" said board member Dr. Robert Cohen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly 40 percent of the roughly 11,500 daily inmates in city jails have a mental health diagnosis, according to the Department of Correction and about a third of them suffer from serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The Associated Press has previously disclosed the deaths of two mentally ill inmates — one who essentially baked to death in a 101-degree cell in February — that have prompted calls for reform. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During a City Council oversight hearing on violence and mental illness at Rikers the day before the inmate moves, Ponte was repeatedly asked about a list of hundreds of inmates who owe time in solitary confinement but are in general population because there's not enough space. Correction officials argue that those inmates, many of whom they say are gang members, drive the violence on Rikers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, Ponte told board members that figure is closer to 1,000 inmates. A number of them are high-risk for harming themselves and others and needed to be separated to stem surging violence, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""What we don't have, and have not had for probably more than five years now, is a plan that's impacted the level of violence on Rikers Island,"" he told the board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were 21 slashings in one recent six-week period and a total of 87 during fiscal year 2014, according to a letter sent by Ponte to board members Monday night and obtained by the AP. There were a total of 68 total such slashing the previous fiscal year and 55 in fiscal 2012, the letter said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Under such circumstances, I felt that it was imperative to take prompt action to prevent further violence,"" he wrote.","Guards at Rikers Island don't just neglect the mentally ill or let them bake to death, they also routinely brutally beat them, often without suffering any repercussions, a New York Times investigation has discovered. The Times uncovered a secret report compiled by a city department this year that found that 129 Rikers inmates suffered ""serious injuries"" in altercations with staff members over an 11-month span last year; 77% of those inmates had a mental health diagnosis. In most cases, the inmates were beaten while handcuffed. The Times investigated the incidents individually, and offer some disturbing details: When guards found Jose Bautista trying to hang himself, they saved him, but then allegedly threw him to the ground and punched him with such force that they perforated his bowel. It was one of five beatings noted in the report that followed a suicide attempt. Bautista needed emergency surgery, but guards took nine hours to drive him to the hospital—which is only 15 minutes away. When Andre Lane threw water or urine at guards, they allegedly handcuffed him to a gurney, wheeled him to a clinic that wasn't monitored by security cameras, and beat him so violently that the walls and cabinets were covered with his blood. After Brian Mack complained that guards were stealing inmates' food, a guard captain allegedly hit him in the eye with his radio, while another officer punched him in the jaw. He came away with a broken eye socket and jaw. Correction officials said he'd been in a fight with another inmate, but investigators noted no such fight was logged in prison records. None of the guards involved in any of the cases have faced criminal charges—or even administrative ones. Rikers has been under pressure to reform its treatment of mentally ill inmates—in January, for example, it announced it would stop putting the ""seriously mentally ill"" in solitary, though the Times notes that classification applies to a small segment of the population. Last week an oversight board said the newly-appointed city jail commissioner had in June illegally sent as many as 47 mentally ill Rikers inmates to solitary without consulting clinicians, the AP reports."

Two pictures show a Marine appearing to pour gasoline or some other flammable on the remains of what officials believe are 2 insurgents. Two other photos show the bodies on fire. You then see charred remains.Another photo shows a Marine crouched down next to a dead body and mugging for the camera.Still another pic shows a Marine rifling through the pocket of the pants on a corpse.We have not included all of the photos. Many are just too gruesome. There are well over a dozen bodies in the pics and some are covered with flies and one is being eaten by a dog.We turned them all over to the Pentagon last week, and a Pentagon official tells us the pics have triggered a Marine Corps investigation.We're told U.S. Central Command -- the organization in charge of military operations in the Middle East -- also reviewed the photos to determine if they had been previously brought to their attention and determined they had not., Director of Press Operations for the Dept. of Defense, tells TMZ ... the pictures appear to show U.S. soldiers in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice ... which makes it a crime to mishandle remains.There is no statute of limitations on the crime -- even if the soldiers are now private citizens ... they can still be prosecuted, which could land them behind bars.Col. Warren tells TMZ, ""The actions that are depicted in these photos are not in any way representative of the honorable, professional service of the 2 1/2 million service members who went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last decade.""  TMZ obtained a trove of photos that allegedly show U.S. Marines posing next to and burning dead bodies of insurgents in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004. (Warning: graphic images ahead.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TMZ leaked 9 of 41 photos that appear to show Marines in Iraq pouring gasoline and then burning the dead bodies of Iraqis. An investigation into the photos has now been opened by the Marine Corps to see whether punishment is necessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We have no details beyond the photos themselves,"" Pentagon spokesperson Commander Bill Speaks told The Wire over the phone, contradicting slightly what TMZ reported. The Defense Department plans to investigate the veracity of the photos and possibly the identify the soldiers involved. Burning bodies directly violates the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Crimes against the code can still be prosecuted, even all these years later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The full set, which TMZ says was turned over to the military last week, allegedly also shows Marines posing next to corpses, a Marine going through a dean man's pockets, and a dog eating one body. ""We have not included all of the photos,"" TMZ says. ""Many are just too gruesome."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The photos were allegedly taken in Fallujah, which, in 2004, was one of the most dangerous cities for U.S. troops at the height of the Iraq war. In the last few weeks, Al Qaeda insurgents took over the city, and the Iraqi military has debated whether or not to attack to reclaim it. ""It is heartbreaking to watch Fallujah descend into this kind of violence again,"" Jessica Lewis, a two-tour Iraq war veteran, told the CBC recently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's the full statement from Commander Speaks:","TMZ is venturing well off the Justin Bieber beat with a potentially serious story about the behavior of Marines during the Iraq war. The site has published eight grisly photos that it says show US troops burning the corpses of Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah in 2004, rifling through pockets, and mugging for the camera. It turned over the full set of 41 photos to the US military last week, and a Pentagon spokesman says an investigation is under way, first to determine the veracity of the images and then to possibly identify any of the Marines. If true, the behavior would violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice on the handling of bodies. ""We have no details beyond the photos themselves,"" a Pentagon spokesperson tells the Wire. In a fuller statement, the spokesperson says ""the actions depicted in these photos are not what we expect from our service members."" Charges could still be filed, even if any of the Marines are no longer in the military. You can see the images at TMZ, but, be warned, they are graphic. (The development comes as Fallujah continues to fall under the sway of al-Qaeda.)"
"Brendan McDermid/Reuters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An $8 billion exchange merger is in the works that underscores how the global market for derivatives has eclipsed that for stocks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The owner of the venerable New York Stock Exchange is in talks to be acquired by an upstart commodities and derivatives trading platform, according to people briefed on the matter. The IntercontinentalExchange is expected to offer about $33 a share, with two-thirds of that in stock, one of these people said. That represents a premium of 37 percent to NYSE Euronext’s closing stock price on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A deal could be announced as soon as Thursday morning, though these people cautioned that talks may still break down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Tools NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the New York Stock Exchange, with its opening bell and floor traders, has been the public image of a stock market for two centuries, it is NYSE Euronext’s businesses in the over-the-counter trading of derivatives — including the Liffe market in London — that appear to be the main attraction in the merger talks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, was founded in 2000 and is based in Atlanta. It competes fiercely with the CME Group, a derivatives trading powerhouse that owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than a year ago, ICE teamed up with the New York exchange’s chief rival, the Nasdaq OMX Group, to make a hostile bid for NYSE Euronext. The two had sought to break up their older competitor’s plan to merge with Deutsche Börse of Europe, which would have created a powerful trans-Atlantic company with a big market share in the trading of stocks and derivatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the terms of that deal, valued at about $11 billion, Nasdaq would have taken NYSE Euronext’s equities business, while ICE would have assumed the derivatives operations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the Justice Department threatened to block that joint offer, on the ground that combining NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq would create an overwhelming monopoly in the world of stock trading. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The planned merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse itself fell apart early this year after European antitrust regulators opposed the combination, on the ground that it would corner too much of the market in exchange-traded derivatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the newest merger might pose fewer problems because ICE focuses on commodities like oil, natural gas and cotton, while NYSE Euronext plies mainly in stock and stock options and derivatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And unlike several proposed mergers, like that of the Singaporean and Australian stock exchanges, which fell apart last year on nationalist concerns, this potential deal would take place between two companies from the same country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After its deal with Deutsche Börse collapsed, NYSE Euronext was left to conduct some soul-searching. At the time, the company said that it would most likely look to smaller acquisitions and cost-cutting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trading of stocks has become a less attractive business. The New York Stock Exchange is now responsible for only about 11 percent of all stock trading, while NYSE Euronext’s electronic Arca platform accounts for another 12 percent, according to industry data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The average number of American stocks traded each day has fallen every year since 2009, and has continued to decline over the course of 2012, according to statistics from Credit Suisse. The volume of trading in futures and options, where ICE is focused, has also fallen since last year, but less than in stocks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A tie-up with ICE, however, would link NYSE Euronext to one of the industry’s fastest-growing exchanges. ICE has some of the highest profit margins in the business. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It might also reap some of the benefits that have driven a decade-long spree of consolidation among exchanges. Such companies have long sought to gain the greater scale and cost savings that come from combining back-end operations and staff cuts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the potential merger would sharply expand ICE, which despite its bigger market value is a smaller company. It has a little more than 1,000 employees, while NYSE Euronext has 3,077. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It isn’t clear whether other exchanges would seek to break up the proposed transaction. The CME Group is a candidate to express opposition. But the firm appeared to have little appetite in bidding for NYSE Euronext last year, and it may run into antitrust concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other potential spoilers, including the Hong Kong and Singaporean exchanges, could run into nationalist concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shares of NYSE Euronext rose more than 21 percent in after-hours trading, to $29.20, after The Wall Street Journal reported news of the talks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting.  Article Excerpt NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York Stock Exchange, the cornerstone of American capitalism for 220 years, agreed to be sold as part of an $8.2 billion takeover by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If regulators and shareholders approve, the combined company would own 14 stock and futures exchanges and five clearing operations that serve as middlemen between buyers and sellers of futures and other contracts, doing more things in more places than any other rival.

ICE, an Atlanta-based commodity exchange, says it intends to leave the NYSE's branding alone, and would explore an IPO for Euronext, spinning it off into a continental European entity, the Wall Street Journal reports. It will pay $33.12 a share for the elder exchange, or about a 37% premium on yesterday's close. You might remember ICE from its last attempt to buy the NYSE, which failed thanks to antitrust concerns from regulators. While the 12-year-old company may lack the name recognition of the iconic NYSE, it's much larger in terms of market capitalization, at $9.3 billion to NYSE Euronext's $5.8 billion—a sign, the New York Times observes, of how completely commodity trading has outpaced stock trading in relevance."

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Suboxone is a prescription drug to help heroin users kick the addiction. However, when it is used alone, Suboxone, an opioid, produces a high.

People once thought grains of sand were the building blocks of what we see around us. Then the atom was discovered, and it was thought indivisible, until it was split to reveal protons, neutrons and electrons inside. These too, seemed like fundamental particles, before scientists discovered that protons and neutrons are made of three quarks each. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""This time we haven't been able to see any evidence at all that there's anything inside quarks,"" said physicist Andy Parker. ""Have we reached the most fundamental layer of matter?"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And even if quarks and electrons are indivisible, Parker said, scientists don't know if they are the smallest bits of matter in existence, or if the universe contains objects that are even more minute. [Graphic: Nature's Tiniest Particles] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parker, a professor of high-energy physics at England's Cambridge University, recently hosted a television special on the U.K.'s BBC Two channel called ""Horizon: How Small is the Universe?"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strings or points? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In experiments, teensy, tiny particles like quarks and electrons seem to act like single points of matter with no spatial distribution. But point-like objects complicate the laws of physics. Because you can get infinitely close to a point, the forces acting on it can become infinitely large, and scientists hate infinities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An idea called superstring theory could solve this issue. The theory posits that all particles, instead of being point-like, are actually little loops of string. Nothing can get infinitely close to a loop of string, because it will always be slightly closer to one part than another. That ""loophole"" appears to solve some of these problems of infinities, making the idea appealing to physicists. Yet scientists still have no experimental evidence that string theory is correct. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another way of solving the point problem is to say that space itself isn't continuous and smooth, but is actually made of discrete pixels, or grains, sometimes referred to as space-time foam. In that case, two particles wouldn't be able to come infinitely close to each other because they would always have to be separated by the minimum size of a grain of space. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A singularity NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another contender for the title of smallest thing in the universe is the singularity at the center of a black hole. Black holes are formed when matter is condensed in a small enough space that gravity takes over, causing the matter to pull inward and inward, ultimately condensing into a single point of infinite density. At least, according to the current laws of physics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But most experts don't think black holes are really infinitely dense. They think this infinity is the product of an inherent conflict between two reigning theories — general relativity and quantum mechanics — and that when a theory of quantum gravity can be formulated, the true nature of black holes will be revealed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""My guess is that [black hole singularities] are quite a lot smaller than a quark, but I don't believe they're of infinite density,"" Parker told LiveScience. ""Most likely they are maybe a million million times or even more than that smaller than the distances we've seen so far."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That would make singularities roughly the size of superstrings, if they exist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Planck length NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Superstrings, singularities, and even grains of the universe could all turn out to be about the size of the ""Planck length."" [Tiny Grandeur: Stunning Photos of the Very Small] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Planck length is 1.6 x 10^-35 meters (the number 16 preceded by 34 zeroes and a decimal point) — an incomprehensibly small scale that is implicated in various aspects of physics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Planck length is far and away too small for any instrument to measure, but beyond that, it is thought to represent the theoretical limit of the shortest measureable length. According to the uncertainty principle, no instrument should ever be able to measure anything smaller, because at that range, the universe is probabilistic and indeterminate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This scale is also thought to be the demarcating line between general relativity and quantum mechanics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It corresponds to the distance where the gravitational field is so strong that it can start to do things like make black holes out of the energy of the field,"" Parker said. ""At the Planck length we expect quantum gravity takes over."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps all of the universe's smallest things are roughly the size of the Planck length.

We're also on Facebook & Google+.","The tiniest thing in the universe is not a grain of sand, as people once thought, nor a proton or neutron, or even a quark or electron—as small as they all are. In fact, experts today balk at naming any point-like object ""the smallest"" because of a theoretical conundrum: When you're infinitely near any point, the forces that act on it turn infinitely huge. Hoping to duck the whole ""infinite"" thing, scientists have invented novel theories around it, physicist Andy Parker tells Space.com. Among the work-arounds: Superstring theory, which posits that particles are like loopy strings rather than points. This would enable scientists to get infinitely close to something but always remain further from another part of it. ""Space-time foam,"" the theory that space is made of pixels or grains. This would keeps particles from being infinitely close to each other, because the grain create a natural distance.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ink-written manuscript is dedicated: ""To Mme Bunkeflod, from her devoted HC Andersen"". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts say it was probably written by the Ugly Duckling author in the 1820s.

"Historians, take note: On this day, which is not a day in 1732, a boundary dispute between two Southern states took a turn for the wet. In a two-page resolution passed overwhelmingly by the state senate, Georgia declared that it, not its neighbor to the north, controls part of the Tennessee River at Nickajack. Georgia doesn't want Nickajack. It wants that water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Georgia's claim is that the boundary between the states was set at latitude 35° north when Georgia first gave up the Mississippi territory, but that a lousy 1818 survey ended up putting that state boundary a mile south of where it should have been. The blue line on this map is a rough approximation of that latitude parallel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Georgia's not worried about its sovereign territory, like the Pennamite Wars that pitted Pennsylvania against Connecticut before the Revolutionary War. Nor is it an ideological conflict like that in the Koreas, which, interestingly, centers around the 38th parallel. What Georgia cares about is that splash of blue that is the Tennessee River. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the summer of 2012, up to 95 percent of the state experienced some level of drought; in December, it hit 99 percent. Last May, nearly a quarter of the state experienced drought that registered as extreme. Despite the state legislature arguing that the drought wasn't that bad (in an effort to avoid hurting the landscaping industry), it was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nor was last year the first time such a drought imperiled the state. In 2008, there was a similarly bad drought — prompting the state to try to gain access to the river by moving the boundary north. Tennessee rejected that effort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Georgia's renewed focus on accessing the river isn't just a smart plan for right now. (Eighty percent of the state is still under drought conditions.) Climate change is likely to ensure ongoing droughts of similar magnitude, making an additional steady source of freshwater a critical need for the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Tennessee agrees to redrawing the state line, the issue would be brought to Congress for approval. If it doesn't, the result probably won't be war. At least not between Georgia and Tennessee. Shortly after leaving the upper corner of Georgia, the river flows into Alabama, which last year saw drought cover 72 percent of its state. The odds are good Alabama isn't eager to give up its water either. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Want to add to this story?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Tennessee Valley Authority has identified the Tennessee River as a likely source of water for North Georgia,” said Sen. David Shafer, R-Duluth, as he presented the resolution. “Yet the state of Tennessee has used mismarked boundary lines to block our access to this important waterway.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Georgia House Resolution 4 proposes a settlement of the boundary dispute, based on almost 200-year-old survey errors, clarifying Georgia’s access to Tennessee River water.

Georgia says the ""mismarked boundary lines"" have denied it access to the Tennessee River as a source of water and it says it will take its northern neighbor to court if it doesn't agree to surrender a slice of land big enough to allow it to do so, reports the Chattanooga Times Free Press. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal would have to sign off on any border change, as would Tennessee and the US Congress, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution adds. ""It is not something that would negatively impact the water supply of Tennessee,"" Deal says. The border dispute isn't likely to spark war between Georgia and Tennessee—but Alabama sits just downstream from the disputed area and, since it has suffered from drought as much as northern Georgia in recent years, it is unlikely to give up its water without some kind of fight, the Atlantic notes."
"The timing was so perfect it felt like a comedy skit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason Rudge, an editor with the Weather Channel, set up on Monday to film the planned destruction of the Georgia Dome, the former home of the Atlanta Falcons and where two Super Bowls were once played.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dome’s destruction promised to be a powerful sight. The explosives wired inside would go off for 12 seconds. Three seconds after that, the entire entire 71,250-seat stadium would be on the ground as a pile of smoking rubble, according to the Associated Press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A man counted down to the implosion on a loud speaker to prepare the crowds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

"In disaster areas, Operation Blue Roof is a program for homeowners who have damage to their roofs. The program sends licensed contractors out to homes to cover the damage with fiber-reinforced plastic sheeting (tarp) until homeowners can arrange repairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Operation Blue Roof allows residents to stay in their homes, instead of paying for temporary housing or hotels. The program also protects property while homeowners recover from the storm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is a free service to homeowners with homes that are primary residences or permanently occupied rental properties that have less than 50 percent structural damage. Vacation rental properties are not eligible for the program. Not all roof types qualify for the program (see eligibility below).  In the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is offering help to Florida residents with a program called “Operation Blue Roof,” which provides fiber-reinforced tarps to homeowners to cover damaged roofs until they can arrange repairs. The only problem is, one federal agency appears to have accidentally directed folks to a phone sex line instead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Consumerist reader pointed us to a two-day-old Tweet from FEMA Region 4’s account, suggesting people who need help can call 1-800-ROOF-BLU or visit the program’s website. Although the Tweet was visible this afternoon, it has since been taken down. Here’s what it looked like: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Callers who dial that number, however, are greeted by an automated message welcoming callers to “America’s hottest talk line,” where “hot ladies” are purportedly waiting to talk to guys, and women can talk to “interesting and exciting guys” for free (apparently, women do not get hot guys). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The correct number, as listed on Operation Blue Roof’s website, is 1-888-ROOF-BLU, not 1-800-ROOF-BLU. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least some people were paying attention to the original Tweet, however, as one Twitter user pointed out that the number was wrong before the Tweet was pulled: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We’ve reached out to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as well as FEMA, and will update this post if we hear back. Though we haven’t yet gotten a response, the Tweet in question was removed after we contacted those agencies, and FEMA Region 4 posted a new Tweet with the correct number: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR #FL: If your roof was damaged due to Hurricane #Irma, Operation Blue Roof may be able to help: 1-888-ROOF-BLU or https://t.co/Y51kOUx1l3 pic.twitter.com/MQw60p96ym — FEMA Region 4 (@femaregion4) September 20, 2017","The Army Corps of Engineers has a helpful program in place called Operation Blue Roof in which Florida residents hit by Hurricane Irma can get sturdy tarps to protect their belongings until their roofs get fixed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By a 3-0 vote, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond revived a May 2013 lawsuit by Devin Copeland, an R&B; singer known as De Rico, and his songwriting partner Mareio Overton, saying a lower court judge was wrong to dismiss it.

"Clint Bench was born with with a congenital deformity that prevented his arms from fully forming. That didn't stop him from going to college, getting married, having children or from riding roller coasters at Six Flags Over Texas. He's done pretty much all of them: Batman, the Texas Giant, the Flashback, you name it. His limbs had never been an issue. Not much is, actually: He can do pullups, fire a gun and go mountain biking, for Christ's sake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, last May, he got on the Aquaman Splashdown ride, a Six Flags standby in which a boat plummets down a two-story decline before sending up a wall of water that soaks riders and the onlookers on the bridge below. It used to be called something generic before it was renamed for a second-tier DC Comics character. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There's nothing particularly dangerous about Aquaman compared with the amusement park's other attractions, certainly nothing Bench couldn't handle, but nevertheless, a Six Flag employee asked Bench to get off the ride. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""She told him that he could not ride Aquaman because he does not have hands,"" according to a lawsuit filed Bench filed yesterday. ""This caused Mr. Bench considerable embarrassment, as his children had never seen anybody discriminate against him due to his lack of natural hands."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he complained to management, he was told that Six Flags policy dictates that riders ""must have at least one fully formed arm all the way down to the fingers."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that wasn't exactly true, at least not until four months later, when Six Flags published an updated riders' guide explicitly stating that riders ""must have one full arm"" to ride Aquaman. The old policy said only that a rider has to be able to grasp, which Bench can do just fine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bench claims discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act. Six Flags doesn't, after all, kick people off rides who, ""for extra thrill or in a silly display of bravado,"" keep their hands in the air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bench is asking for unspecified damages for suffering and mental anguish. And he still wants to ride Aquaman, goddammit.  One Texas man is accusing Six Flags of barring him from a ride because he doesn't have hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clint Bench who was born without hands due to a congenital deformity, has led an active lifestyle, not letting his lack of hands stop him from mountain biking, getting a college education and doing one of his favorite activities: thrill-seeking at amusement parks, according to the Dallas News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That is until one May 2012 trip to a Six Flags in Arlington, Texas, where an employee refused to allow him to ride an attraction called the Aquaman Splashdown he’d been on several times before. Bench was apparently in violation of a new policy that said he ""must have at least one fully formed arm all the way down to the fingers,"" The Dallas Observer reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""This caused Mr. Bench considerable embarrassment, as his children had never seen anybody discriminate against him due to his lack of natural hands,” according to Bench’s lawsuit, which rather than money, seeks only to ensure “that this doesn’t happen again,” he told CBS Dallas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Six Flags declined to comment to CBS Dallas because the lawsuit is ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move seems somewhat of an about-face for Six Flags, which has historically been accommodating to those with disabilities. Disabled guests of the park were often allowed to cut lines and then given the opportunity to make reservations until 2007, when the park determined people were faking injuries to take advantage of the policy, Theme Park Insider notes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sadly, this isn’t the only Six Flags lawsuit concerning those without four full limbs. In 2008, Six Flags made a confidential settlement with Kaitlyn Lassiter, a then 13-year-old guest whose feet were severed while riding the Superman Tower of Power, the Louisville Courier-Journal reports.

Clint Bench alleges that last May a Six Flags Over Texas employee wouldn't let him on the Aquaman Splashdown (a variation on the classic log flume). When he complained, management told him Six Flags policy required riders to ""have at least one fully formed arm all the way down to the fingers"" to ride, according to the Dallas Observer. Bench was chagrined, given that he'd ridden the ride before. According to the Observer, Six Flags didn't have any such published policy at the time; it showed up in an updated riders' guide four months later.

"MINNEAPOLIS — A Minnesota restaurant owner upset over what happened in St. Cloud posted a controversial sign Monday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sign outside Treats Family Restaurant in Lonsdale, Minnesota, reads “Muslims Get Out.” A second line reads “In Support Of St. Cloud,” reports CBS Minnesota. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, a man stabbed several people at a St. Cloud mall, allegedly asking victims if they were Muslim before attacking them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Restaurant owner Dan Ruedinger says the sign has led to some backlash, but he says business is up so much that he had to call in three extra workers Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s time that people started standing up, not worrying about the PC crowd and do what is right,” Ruedinger said. “And I feel what we’re doing is right. We are not targeting the Muslims in general, just the extremists. And that’s all I can say. It’s my right and I’m going to stand up, and I wish more people would do it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Payten Estepp was part of a group protesting the sign Monday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I get it, it’s his right to say what he wants to say,” Estepp said. “But that’s giving Lonsdale a bad rap to everyone that drives by on 19, which is a very busy road, so people are going to see that and they’re going to think Lonsdale as a whole, as a community, is as crass as that sign.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ruedinger says he has no plans to take down or change the sign.

Low 76F. Winds S at 10 to 20 mph.  13 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (507) 744-4945 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I live in Lonsdale, so have been here a few times. I'll start with the positive: I quite like the ice cream selection, er, it's actually more of an ""ice milk"" than cream, like Dairy Queen, but we're all used to that by now. Typical soft serve, nothing to phone home about, but it's fine. They've got all the stuff you'd expect to find at DQ, so not bad a bad stop for an ice cream fix. However, I'd veer away from the cooked food. They claim the burgers are hand made, not frozen, and I'm sure that may be true...there's plenty of butchers nearby that could be providing fresh meat. The only issue is, they're screwing the burgers up...they're super gritty, greasy, and don't have any seasoning/flavor to speak of. You can put toppings on which makes it ok, but really nothing worth stopping for. Most other items on the menu are just defrosted, deep fried, and awful. The cheese curds could be good...but they don't drain the oil off so by the time they get to you they're all stuck together and soggy. One thing I do kind of like is the Sloppy Joe, or ""Sloppy Dan"" as it's referred to here, which I believe is also supposed to be an in-house recipe. It's decent. My mom's is better...but hey, she's hard to beat. Also, there's something odd about the third-rate non-name-brand fountain soda they have, it seems the syrup was frozen or something, as it tastes freezer-burnt. Why would you freeze syrup? Something isn't quite right there, maybe it's just really bad soda. What keeps me from going back at all even for the decent ice cream is the service, frankly. Customer service skills are lacking in everyone who works here, from the young kids they hire all the way to the owners - except maybe the wife as an exception, she's usually pretty nice. No one else seems to be enjoying their time there. This isn't a cheap political shot since the owner is very political, you'll see lawn signs all over the place and while I think whatever floats your boat, it shows a lack of business know-how (who would alienate half their customers) and makes me wonder how the judgement is in the rest of his business decisions. It's genuinely true that the environment isn't pleasant. Most importantly, if there's more than one person in the restaurant, it can also take a long time to be served or for your food to be made. Should you decide to try for yourself, my recommendation is to call ahead, and just pick it up through the drive thru window....as there's nothing special about the decor or hospitality. I believe the owner delivers the food locally as well, but you'd have to call and ask if that's still the case.","Muslim families won't be offered any treats at the Treats Family Restaurant in Lonsdale, southern Minnesota: Owner Dan Ruedinger has arranged the sign board outside to read ""Muslims Get Out."" The sign says it is in ""suport"" of St. Cloud, where a Somali-American man stabbed nine people in a mall last weekend. Despite what his sign says, Ruedinger says he's not against all Muslims, only extremists. ""It’s time that people started standing up, not worrying about the PC crowd and do what is right,” he tells CBS. ""And I feel what we’re doing is right."" Ruedinger, whose Yelp page has been inundated with negative reviews, says putting up the sign is his First Amendment right. Ruedinger says Islam is a ""religion of hatred that preaches violence""—and the Muslims who are ""good people"" should ""hold the others accountable."" The Lonsdale News-Review reports that Muslim leaders, including Jaylani Hussein of the state chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, met Ruedinger for what Hussein describes as a ""short conversation."" A witness says Ruedinger became agitated and started shouting about his son's service in Iraq.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ida Lockett of Sacramento, Calif., said her 5-year-old son received the toy as a birthday present, and when she was helping him assemble it, she noticed the instructions — telling her to put a play shackle around the figure’s neck. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This right here was found on his neck,” she told CBS Sacramento about the piece.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s definitely racist,” Lockett told the CBS affiliate. “It told my son to put a slave cuff around the black character’s neck, and then to play with the toy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lockett said the set was a gift from the boy’s aunt, who purchased it from Toys R Us. The set retails for $89.99 but the store is selling it for $62.99. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playmobil said in a statement to The Washington Post that the toy was intended to portray life on a 17th-century pirate ship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If you look at the box, you can see that the pirate figure is clearly a crew member on the pirate ship and not a captive,” according to the statement. “The figure was meant to represent a pirate who was a former slave in a historical context.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aimee Norman, the aunt who gave the set to the Sacramento 5-year-old, wrote on the Playmobil USA Facebook page that she was “MORTIFIED to have recently bought” the pirate ship set for her nephew, “only to hear that when assembling it, they found that its assembly instructions indicate to add the neck cuff/shackle to the black character’s neck.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “WOW,” she wrote. “Would it be too much to ask for you to just create a regular old black pirate?

"On the evening of Tuesday, November 17, and into the morning of Wednesday, November 18, the Leonid meteor shower will hit its peak. The annual event, caused by bits of ice and rock burning in Earth’s atmosphere, will create a host of shooting stars above the eastern horizon around midnight in the U.S. (local time on both coasts, when the constellation Leo rises). Here’s our guide to the shower. Where To Look, And When Any single meteor might appear anywhere, but for the most part Tuesday’s shooting stars will appear to come from the constellation Leo—hence, “Leonids.” Leo will rise above the eastern horizon at about midnight local time across the continent. But meteors will be visible even before then. So if you're in the U.S. and the skies are clear, head out any time after sunset on Tuesday, November 17, and look east. Try to find a dark site away from street lights, or better yet, away from cities altogether. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leo, the apparent origin point for the meteors, rises in the east at midnight. That’s the direction to look to maximize the chance of spotting a shooting star Tuesday night. (This chart shows the constellations at midnight local time for the mid-latitudes of the U.S.) Katie Peek / Popular Science NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Likely Awesomeness Rating: Medium The Leonids peak every three decades, and this shower comes mid-cycle—the last peak was in 1998. So we won’t see a phenomenal number of shooting stars. (If you’re bummed about that, console yourself with some of the illustrations of the famous 1833 Leonid meteor storm—a pretty incredible event.) This year, NASA predicts we’ll see one meteor about every four minutes. That’s a moderate rate. But in this year’s favor, the moon will be a crescent, which means a darker sky that makes streaks of light easier to spot. Strike against: the current cloud-cover forecast predicts overcast skies for a good fraction of the U.S. that night. Why Now? The Leonids happen every year around November 17. That’s when the Earth passes through the cloud of debris left behind by the comet Tempel-Tuttle. Don’t worry about an actual impact—Tempel-Tuttle is currently further than Uranus. We’re just crossing its orbit. There’s no chance we’ll hit the comet itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Leonid meteor shower happens in November each year because that’s when the Earth, moseying along its orbit, passes through the debris field of the comet Tempel-Tuttle.

Unfortunately, clouds will cover much of the skies across the US, but those in areas with a clear forecast will enjoy a dark backdrop for the colorful meteors thanks to a crescent moon. NASA predicts there will be about 15 meteors per hour, or one every four minutes, at peak time. If you can't make it until midnight, some meteors will also be visible to the east after sunset, reports Popular Science."

"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - The United States should not allow a delegation from Taiwan to attend U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, China’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, raising a new bone of contention in Beijing’s relations with the incoming government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A demonstrator holds flags of Taiwan and the United States in support of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen during an stop-over after her visit to Latin America in Burlingame, California, U.S., January 14, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam - RTSVJRJ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump broke with decades of precedent last month by taking a congratulatory telephone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, and he has also said the “One China” policy was up for negotiation, a position Beijing strongly rejected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Taiwan delegation, led by former premier and ex-ruling party leader Yu Shyi-kun, and including a Taiwan national security adviser and some lawmakers, will attend Friday’s inauguration, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is typical for Taiwan to send a delegation to U.S. presidential inaugurations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesman for Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s office said no meetings were scheduled with the new Trump administration while the delegation was there for the event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China considers Taiwan a breakaway province, with no right to have any kind of diplomatic relations with other countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was opposed to Taiwan using any excuse to send people to the United States to “engage in activities to interfere in or damage China-U.S. ties”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We again urge the relevant side in the United States not to allow the Taiwan authority to send a so-called delegation to the United States to attend the presidential inauguration and not have any form of official contact with Taiwan,” Hua told a regular news briefing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “China’s position has already accurately and unmistakably been given to the U.S. administration and Trump’s team.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, will attend the inauguration on its behalf, she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in wanting to be run by Beijing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China is deeply suspicious of Taiwan’s Tsai, whom it suspects of wanting to push for the island’s formal independence, a red line for China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tsai, who visited the U.S. this month while traveling to and from Central America, says she wants to maintain peace with China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The administration of President Barack Obama has repeatedly reinforced the U.S. commitment to the “one China” policy, under which Washington acknowledges China’s position of sovereignty over Taiwan, since Trump’s call with the Taiwanese leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump is to be sworn into office on Friday.  BEIJING (AP) — China on Wednesday called on the U.S. to bar a Taiwanese delegation from attending Donald Trump's inauguration on Friday, underscoring concerns that the incoming president could seek to redefine relations between Beijing, Taipei and Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the request had been passed to Trump's transition team and to the current administration of Barack Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We urge the U.S. side once again not to allow the Taiwan administration to send the so-called delegation to attend the inauguration and to avoid any forms of official exchange with Taiwan,"" Hua said at a daily briefing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China firmly opposes ""anyone from the Taiwan administration engaged in activities that interfere or undermine the China-U.S. relationship in the U.S. under any pretext,"" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Delegation leader and former Premier Yu Shyi-kun departed for Washington on Monday together with politicians from both Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Nationalists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Along with attending the inauguration, the delegates plan to hold talks with politicians, academics and overseas Chinese community representatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump angered Beijing and upset decades of diplomatic precedent by talking by phone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen shortly after winning November's presidential election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, he said in a newspaper interview that Washington's ""one China policy"" under which it recognized Beijing in 1979 was open to negotiation, and earlier questioned why the U.S. should be bound by such an approach without China offering incentives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. has no formal relations with Taipei in deference to China, which claims the island as its own. However, the two maintain robust informal ties, while Washington sells Taiwan arms and is legally bound to regard any threat to the island as a matter of grave concern. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have risen since Tsai's election last year, with Beijing cutting off contacts and working to deepen Taiwan's diplomatic isolation.","A tense political triangle just got even stickier in advance of Donald Trump's inauguration. China's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday the US shouldn't allow a Taiwanese delegation to attend Friday's ceremony, Reuters reports. This request was passed to both the Trump transition team and to President Obama's people, a Foreign Ministry rep said, per the AP. Taiwan's own Foreign Ministry announced earlier this week that, as per usual protocol during US presidential inaugurations, it would be sending a delegation, including ex-Premier Yu Shyi-kun, a national security adviser, and a sprinkling of legislators. China hasn't been happy with the incoming administration since Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in early December. A Tsai rep tells Reuters no delegation members are scheduled to meet in any official capacity with members of the Trump administration during their trip."

An angry barber allegedly retaliated against a 22-year-old customer by shaving his head down the middle and snipping his ear with scissors, leaving him bloodied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He requested a No. 2 on the sides, and an inch taken off the top with scissors, police spokesman Joel Despain said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 22-year-old customer, who wasn't named in the Madison Police Department press release , had gone to the salon to get his hair cut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police arrested 46-year-old Khaled A. Shabani at Ruby's Salon in Madison, Wisconsin, after the alleged incident, which they said occurred on Dec. 22. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, his cut soon went south. He claimed Shabani began complaining he was fidgeting and moving his head, and twisted his ear. Then, Shabani allegedly grabbed a ""zero"" clipper, ""snipped"" his ear, and shaved a line in his head. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""[The victim] was starting to bleed when the 'zero' was used to cut a close path down the middle of his head, leaving him looking a bit like Larry from the Three Stooges,"" Despain said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The victim then got up and left, with Shabani allegedly shouting after him, ""You want a zero right?"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The man called police when he got home, and Shabani was arrested on suspicion of mayhem and disorderly conduct while armed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""While it is not a crime to give someone a bad haircut, you will get arrested for intentionally snipping their ear with a scissors,"" Despain said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, Shabani pleaded not guilty to disorderly conduct, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. The charge is a violation of a county ordinance, not criminal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When reached by BuzzFeed News, the Madison Police Department had no further information.","A young man who went for a pre-Christmas haircut got a disorderly one, while his barber got slammed for disorderly conduct, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Per Madison police spokesman Joel DeSpain, the 22-year-old patron headed over to Ruby's Salon on Friday and asked for an inch off the top and the sides shaved, and his stylist, 46-year-old Khaled A. Shabani, set to work. The police report notes the customer asked for a No. 2 buzzer for the sides and that scissors be used to trim the top. The customer soon realized things were ""not going well,"" however, when Shabani started chastising him for not keeping his head still, which earned him an ear-twisting, per the report. The situation got worse when Shabani allegedly ""snipped"" his ear with the scissors, drawing blood, and used a ""zero"" buzzer (which provides the closest cut) to swoop right down the middle of his head. The result? The customer got a buzz that left him ""looking a bit like Larry from the Three Stooges,"" DeSpain says. Which is when the customer says he got up to leave, with Shabani allegedly yelling after him, ""You want a zero, right?"" Shabani was cited for mayhem and disorderly conduct while armed, which the Journal notes is not a criminal charge but a county ordinance violation. ""While it is not a crime to give someone a bad haircut, you will get arrested for intentionally snipping their ear with a scissors,"" DeSpain says. The customer had another stylist elsewhere shave his head all the way to rid himself of the Stooges look. Per a police report, Shabani told cops the ear-snipping was an accident, but BuzzFeed reports on Yelp reviews that note other bad experiences at the salon, including one ex-patron that says his visit felt like it ""[bordered] on assault."""
"MEXICO CITY (AP) — A species of snake that had been ""lost"" for almost 80 years has been re-discovered on a remote Mexican island. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a study published in the PLOS ONE scientific journal, the Clarion nightsnake was found again on one of the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles (650 kilometers) off Mexico's Pacific coast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The original, and until recently the only, spotting of the species was made by American naturalist William Beebe in a 1936 visit to Clarion, one of the four Revillagigedo Islands. He returned with one snake preserved in a glass jar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and no further sightings were reported over the years from the island, which is inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines. The existing dead sample was assumed to be a labelling error and the snake was largely struck from taxonomic registries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher for the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected it might still exist. He and Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martinez Gomez, an expert on the Revillagigedo Islands, noted the islands change a lot from season to season, so they timed the expedition last May to replicate Beebe's steps as they looked for the snake, which blends in with the island's rock formations and is largely active at night. And they used Beebe's original field notes as a guide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Basically, following those directions, we essentially put ourselves in his place,"" Martinez Gomez said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of his graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot one of the snakes for the first time since 1936. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers performed DNA analysis to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and see where it had come from. The tests showed it is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) away. Martinez Gomez said the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Museum of Natural History said Mulcahy ""uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record, and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patricia Escalante, a biologist who curates bird collections at Mexico's National Autonomous University and who was not involved in the snake project, said the re-discovery of the Clarion nightsnake was ""very interesting"" and significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One inhabitant of the Revillagigedo Islands, the Socorro dove, went extinct in its natural habitat sometime in the 1970s. But live specimens had been taken off the islands in the 1920s, and their descendants were recently re-introduced to the islands.  Image copyright Daniel Mulcahy Image caption The Clarion Nightsnake has a distinctive pattern of spots Photo: Daniel Mulcahy NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A lost species of snake that eluded scientists for nearly 80 years has been rediscovered in Mexico, a US museum says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Clarion Nightsnake was found on the Pacific island of Clarion in Mexico by a researcher from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The snake was first discovered in 1936 by naturalist William Beebe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although never declared extinct, it was struck from the record after scientists were unable to rediscover it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The museum said that researcher Daniel Mulcahy, working with an expert from a Mexican institute, carried out an expedition to Clarion Island where their team identified 11 snakes matching Beebe's description. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Nightsnake was indeed genetically distinct from others found in mainland Mexico. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The museum said the snake species is found exclusively on the island and could have remained unknown to science if not for the team's efforts. It is now recognised as a full species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in,"" Mr Mulcahy said in a museum statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Proper identification is the first step toward conserving this snake, and we plan to continue monitoring this species to learn more about the role it plays in the delicate Clarion Island ecosystem.""","The Clarion nightsnake is hard to spot, so hard to spot that for decades, the only sighting of the species native to one of Mexico's Revillagigedo Islands—the original sighting—was assumed to be a mistake. A joint US-Mexico team, however, managed to rediscover the species found by American naturalist William Beebe in 1936 by using his original field notes to retrace his steps and search for the nocturnal snake, which blends in with the island's rock formations, the AP reports. The expedition found 11 of the snakes, and DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Island snake is a unique species, reports the BBC. The snake is related to snakes found on part of the Mexican coast more than 500 miles away, and researchers believe its ancestors may have arrived on a tree trunk washed out to sea long ago. Beebe returned from a visit to the island, located 400-plus miles off Mexico's Pacific coast, nearly 80 years ago with a snake preserved in a jar, but his sample had long been considered a labeling error and his find was largely struck from taxonomic registries. The National Museum of Natural History praised the team's work, describing the snake as the ""only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error."" The rediscovery ""is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in,"" the museum said in a statement."
"PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey authorities say a driver fled the scene of an accident with a fire hydrant stuck to his car and then tossed it in the trash.

Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) speaks to members of the media after a hearing in November 2012. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), one of the Republicans most vulnerable to a conservative primary challenge, will retire in 2014 rather than seek a third term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chambliss denied in a statement Friday morning that the potential primary was a factor in his decision, saying he was confident he would have won re-election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Instead, this is about frustration, both at a lack of leadership from the White House and at the dearth of meaningful action from Congress, especially on issues that are the foundation of our nation’s economic health,"" Chambliss said. ""The debt-ceiling debacle of 2011 and the recent fiscal-cliff vote showed Congress at its worst and, sadly, I don’t see the legislative gridlock and partisan posturing improving anytime soon."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news of Chambliss's retirement was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Republican House members, Paul Broun and Tom Price, were considering campaigns against Chambliss. Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel was also interested in the race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite his largely conservative record, Chambliss has attracted conservative ire for his interest in bipartisan compromise. His recent public break with anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist earned him particular scrutiny. He also struggled in the 2008 election, forced into a runoff with Democrat Jim Martin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), another senator vulnerable to a primary challenge, responded with ""great sadness and disappointment"" to the news of his friend's retirement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Given how many big names were already interested in the seat, there will almost certainly be a crowded primary. Polling suggests former presidential candidate Herman Cain would be a strong contender, but he said again Friday that he is not running. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats are also expressing interest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Georgia will now offer Democrats one of our best pick-up opportunities of the cycle,"" said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Executive Director Guy Cecil, noting changing demographics and a potentially divisive GOP primary. ""This will be a top priority.” Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed is considered a top Democratic prospect, along with Rep. John Barrow.  Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss is theoretically very vulnerable to a primary challenger in 2014: it's just a question of whether any of the folks interested in taking him on can run a strong enough campaign to take advantage of that vulnerability. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only 38% of Republican primary voters say they want Chambliss to be their nominee next year, compared to 43% who would prefer someone more conservative. But Chambliss stomps most of the people who've shown the most interest in taking him on. He leads Congressman Paul Broun by a 57/14 margin in a head to head, has a 50/22 advantage over Congressman Tom Price, and leads former Secretary of State Karen Handel 52/23. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By far and away the Republican who would pose the greatest threat to Chambliss in a primary, if he changed his mind about running, is Herman Cain. Cain would lead Chambliss 50-36 in a hypothetical match up. Cain has a 68/20 favorability rating with GOP primary voters, which compares quite favorably to Chambliss' 45/36 approval spread. Other long shot candidates we tested against Chambliss were Allen West, who trails 47/26, and Erick Erickson who trails 51/22. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chambliss is extremely weak with Republicans describing themselves as 'very conservative.' 61% of them would like to replace him, compared to only 23% who would like to see him nominated again. He would trail Cain 68/19 with that group of voters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In terms of the general election the Georgia Senate race is somewhat reminiscent of the Indiana contest this cycle- if Chambliss is the nominee the seat is probably safe for the GOP, but if someone far to his right wins the primary the Democrats might have a chance if everything goes their way.","Saxby Chambliss will announce today that he doesn't intend to run for re-election when his Senate term ends in 2014, sources tell the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Chambliss reportedly told his senior staff about the decision this morning. Chambliss was considered one of the Republicans most ripe for a primary challenge, the Washington Post observes, thanks to his track record of bipartisan compromise and recent break with Grover Norquist. Potential successors are sure to come out of the woodwork now. Two House members, Paul Broun and Tom Price, had already been considering primary challenges, and more, including Phil Gingrey and Tom Graves, are likely to consider throwing their hats in now. But there are also some bigger name possibilities: A recent poll, for instance, shows that Herman Cain would have trounced Chambliss in a primary, meaning he would be an early favorite if he decided to run."
"A U.K. soldier killed by a Taliban bomb in Afghanistan will be posthumously giving 32 of his friends the vacation of a lifetime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the Sun is reporting, British Royal Marine David Hart took out a 250,000 pound (or about $400,000) insurance policy before he was deployed with instructions that $150,000 of that amount should go toward a Las Vegas holiday for his pals and their girlfriends.

"The Oklahoma department of corrections is in dispute with the city of McAlester over who owns the state’s unwired electric chair, which may be put back into service if challenges to Oklahoma’s lethal injection procedure are upheld. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corrections spokesman Jerry Massie said the electric chair is in storage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We haven’t had much discussion about it, because it’s not been real pressing at the moment,” Massie said. “We haven’t had that discussion yet, seriously.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked if the chair would be rewired and used again, Massie said: “It is possible.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he added: “There is not much possibility of that, unless lethal injection is declared unconstitutional."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State law allows for the electric chair or a firing squad to be used only if lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional. Oklahoma’s execution procedures are under review after the April 29 botched lethal injection of Clayton Lockett, who writhed, groaned and tried to speak. He suffered what corrections director Robert Patton said appeared to be a massive heart attack and died 43 minutes after the execution began. There have been no executions in the US since Lockett's. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorneys for Charles Warner, who was to die the same night as Lockett in a rare double execution, are watching the review closely. He was granted a stay of execution after Lockett's death and is now scheduled to die on November 13. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dispute over the chair predates the current execution crisis. Massie told the McAlester News-Capital on Friday that he stands by the department’s claim to the chair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McAlester mayor Steve Harrison told the Guardian that the electric chair should be on display for the public to see. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I would like to get it displayed somewhere since it is a historical artefact,” Harrison said. “I don’t think it does anybody any good for it to sit in storage somewhere.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the chair, nicknamed Old Sparky, had been in a museum McAlester – a town of about 18,000 that is home to the state’s death chamber – until the corrections department took it back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The transfer happened a number of years ago, and I’m not sure anybody has the complete story on who legally owns it,” Harrison said. “I’m not sure where it is.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harrison said he expects if Oklahoma planned to electrocute an inmate, the state would get a new electric chair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That chair has not been used since 1966,” Harrison said. “My assumption would be if it ever got to the point the electric chair was needed again they would start with a new one. Can’t imagine they would use one that hasn’t been used in 50 years.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The chair, first used in 1915, was used to execute 82 inmates before it was retired. The last inmate to sit in it was James French, who was killed on 10 August, 1966, for the murder of his cellmate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bill Ervin, of McAlester, whose law firm represents the city, said the chair is “not much to look at.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s an antique,” Ervin said. “If that’s the one they’re talking about, I don’t know why they would use that one (in an execution).” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As states grapple with a European-led boycott over lethal injection drugs, some have proposed returning to old methods such as the electric chair and the firing squad. This month, Tennessee’s governor approved the use of the electric chair for executions where drugs could not be acquired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some states – Florida, Alabama and Virginia – have long listed electrocution as an optional execution method. The last US inmate to die by electrocution was Robert Gleason, who chose it over lethal injection and was killed on 16 January, 2013, in Virginia.

A city in Oklahoma wants the state to give it back ""Old Sparky,"" an electric chair last used about 50 years ago. McAlester officials want to put it on display as a piece of history. But the state says it's keeping Old Sparky in storage, just in case the relic needs to be fired up again. ""That would be possible,"" a state DOC spokesperson tells the McAlester News-Capital. Old Sparky had its heyday from 1915 to 1966, when it was used to execute 82 inmates at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. It now sits mothballed in a state facility, as the city and the DOC bicker over who owns it. The newspaper has a letter from the DOC to the city in 2010 in which it explains why the state needed to keep the chair. “In the event our lethal injection protocol is ruled unconstitutional, the electric chair must be used by the state as the back-up method of execution."" That might have seemed far-fetched at the time, but the state's lethal injection policies are now, in fact, under review after the botched execution of an inmate last month. Tennessee, meanwhile, just brought back its electric chair. All that is understood, says McAlester's mayor, but ...

But again, if it's true. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update 2: Another Anon Twitter account has chimed in, downplaying the significance of the arrest: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sponsored NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it is Ryan then they're alright. lol #LulzSec NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ""if"" in there indicates there may be some internal confusion within the AntiSec campaign as to who has actually been arrested. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update 3: LulzSec's official Twitter account has joined the this-doesn't-matter chorus: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seems the glorious leader of LulzSec got arrested, it's all over now... wait... we're all still here! Which poor bastard did they take down? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update 4: Well this just got a bit more interesting! Yet another Anon Twitter user is claiming the Ryan in question is Ryan Cleary—a kid previously associated with attacking Anonymous in an attempted ""coup d'etat"" of sorts, Hacker News reported in May: ""Mr Cleary was accused of stealing passwords and targeting the network servers used to keep Anonymous's websites running."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cleary's personal information was then revenge-posted online—pinning him to Wickford, Essex, exactly as the BBC said earlier this morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So this is strange. Ryan was apparently despised by Anonymous, and described today as a LulzSec IRC admin. With the two forces united for the time being, his place in all of this seems... tense. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update 5: LulzSec's put out a further clarifying tweet, this one more conclusive than the last: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ryan Cleary is not part of LulzSec; we house one of our many legitimate chatrooms on his IRC server, but that's it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, despite whatever beef Ryan had with Anon, LulzSec's just been using him for his servers, and is distancing itself from him in any other capacity.","British police have arrested a 19-year-old that they believe is involved with LulzSec’s recent wave of “AntiSec” digital attacks—though the group seems to be denying it. Investigators found the teen with help from the FBI, and have charged him under the Computer Misuse Act and the Fraud Act, ZDNet reports. But LulzSec’s official Twitter account chimed in, saying, “Seems the glorious leader of LulzSec got arrested, it's all over now... wait... we're all still here! Which poor bastard did they take down?” Some tweets from LulzSec’s new ally, Anonymous, might shed some light on that. “The good news everybody: Ryan has little to do with #LulzSec besides running IRC,” one Anonymous member tweeted, according to Gizmodo. Another member identified the Ryan in question as Ryan Cleary, a hacker who last gained notoriety for, of all things, attacking Anonymous. Cleary lived in Wickford, Essex, the same location as the man arrested today. “If it is Ryan then they’re alright. lol,” another Anonymous member tweeted."

In this Nov. 14, 2014 file photo Jesse Matthew Jr., right, looks toward the gallery while appearing in court in Fairfax, Va. (Bill O'leary/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR — The man accused of abducting and killing University of Virginia sophomore Hannah Graham last fall will now face a charge of capital murder in the case, meaning that if he is convicted he could face the death penalty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jesse L. Matthew Jr., 33, had been charged with first-degree murder in Graham’s slaying, and the charges were upgraded at a court hearing in this college town on Tuesday. Homicides in Virginia can be charged as capital murders when there are allegations of aggravating factors, including abduction or sexual assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Graham, 18, of Fairfax County, Va., went missing in September from an outdoor mall near the U-Va. campus, and Matthew was the last person seen with her. Her body was found in a wooded area about 10 miles from campus weeks later, and Matthew was charged with her killing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [For Hannah Graham’s family, ‘nightmare’ leaves enduring uncertainty and loss.] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities have alleged that Matthew abducted Graham “with intent to defile,” indicating that police believe he intended to sexually assault Graham. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Albemarle County Commonwealth’s Attorney Denise Lunsford initially did not seek a capital murder charge, saying she made that decision after consulting with Graham’s family and weighing the impact on the community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Matthew also is facing charges related to a sexual assault from nearly a decade ago. He is awaiting trial on charges that he attacked and attempted to kill a woman in Fairfax City in 2005; authorities have said that they found Matthew’s DNA under one of the victim’s fingernails. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Graham, a U-Va. sophomore who graduated from West Potomac High School, disappeared after a night out in Charlottesville on Sept. 12. Police said she had been socializing with friends earlier in the night but left the group with plans to meet up with them later. She never showed up and apparently became disoriented while walking through Charlottesville. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police said witnesses saw Matthew with his arm around Graham at a downtown mall about 1 a.m. Sept. 13, and surveillance video recordings show the two walking together. Witnesses also saw the two together outside a restaurant, the last reported sighting of Graham.","The man accused of abducting and murdering a University of Virginia sophomore will now face the death penalty. Prosecutors today announced a charge of capital murder against 33-year-old Jesse Matthew in the death of Hannah Graham last year, reports the Daily Progress. Prosecutors initially didn't seek the death penalty, but the state attorney for Albemarle County said today that there is ""compelling evidence from the lab that capital charges are now appropriate."" Denise Lunsford didn't offer specifics, but the Washington Post notes that capital charges can be brought when ""aggravating factors"" such as sexual assault are present. As a result of the capital murder charge, Matthew was appointed new attorneys because his previous defense team did not have experience with death-penalty cases. Matthew also is a suspect in a 2005 sexual assault, and his DNA has been linked to the body of a young woman found outside Charlottesville in 2009."

"UPDATE: The most recent version of this story can be found here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STATEN ISLAND -- Police sources say they have a ""person of interest"" in custody in connection with a string of fake bombs planted across the Island this month -- a jealous ex-lover hoping to get the police to arrest his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though no charges have been filed yet, investigators believe that ""hoax devices"" were left in Port Richmond, Randall Manor and Grymes Hill as part of a grudge between the two men, sources said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least one device had a note written in Spanish accompanying it, those sources said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most recent device, found in a computer bag on Saturday outside a home on Duncan Road in Grymes Hill, contained a propane container, with what looked like wires coming out, connected to another container of liquid, according to law enforcement sources. It wouldn't have exploded, those sources said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police found two similar devices earlier this month -- one on Sept. 12, in a backpack by a black Toyota on Brentwood Avenue in Randall Manor, the other on Sept. 2, in a suitcase on an uninhabited stretch of Barrett Avenue just behind the Forest Avenue Shoppers Town strip mall in Port Richmond. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The devices spurred the NYPD to form a task force over the weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police also responded to four separate false alarms involving discarded bags since the first device was found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police sources say that investigators don't believe terrorism to be a motive in the creation of the devices.  Madman Staten Island bomber arrested after leaving three devices around borough: authorities The 54-year-old suspect was fueled by jealousy - his target was a man who lived on his block and recently married a woman the suspect liked, authorities said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The madman bomber responsible for leaving three inert devices on Staten Island was taken into custody Wednesday — and police believe he may have been fueled by jealousy, authorities said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cops took the 54-year-old suspect in for questioning at his job in Manhattan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bomber was lovestruck by a woman, 32, who lived nearby and had just gotten married this past Saturday - the day of the final incident — and the suspect was targeting the woman’s beau, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All three know each other and live on the same block. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The note left behind at each device had the 35-year-old target’s name and address. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suspect, whose name was not released, is being questioned at the 121st Precinct stationhouse. Charges are pending.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oates, Michael/Michael Oates NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suspect’s spree had triggered an all-out manhunt by the NYPD, sources said Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A task force of about 10 investigators has been put together to arrest the person who left three bombs in residential areas around the borough beginning on Sept. 2, police sources said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The homemade devices — propane cylinders duct taped to vials filled with gasoline attached to a container of nails and screws — were found inside laptop bags with wires sticking out of them, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least one of the devices had a nine-volt battery attached to it, police sources said. Another came with a clock, but the clock was not wired to the device. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RELATED: NYPD EVACUATES STATEN ISLAND BLOCK AFTER FAKE BOMB FIND NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All three of the bombs had a threatening note in Spanish attached to them, a source said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cops are concerned because if the devices were rigged properly, they could have exploded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oates, Michael/Michael Oates NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Whenever you have propane and gas and you can light it, you will have some sort of explosion that will cause damage,” a police source said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cops evacuated nine homes on Cornell St. near Decker Ave. in Elm Park on Sept. 2 after the first fake bomb was discovered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of the NYPD Bomb Squad deployed a robot to open the laptop bag and inspect the would-be bomb, which didn’t contain an explosive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Nothing like this has ever happened here,” Elm Park resident Nievas Pavia, 31, who lived near where the laptop bag was discovered, told the Daily News at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We were shocked and worried because we weren't told anything... just that we had to leave.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second device — the only one not found in a laptop case — was was found sitting next to a parked car on Brentwood Ave. near Henderson Ave. in Randall Manor, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A crew of sanitation workers accidentally picked up the third gadget — which was placed among some garbage bags —on Duncan Road near Silver Lake Park at 8 a.m. Saturday.

As constructed, they apparently wouldn't have been able to explode, say police, though it's not clear whether that was by design or ignorance.

With each device was an angry note that implicated her husband, says the Daily News. The suspect was being questioned this afternoon, and charges are pending.

"Google Glass: How It Will Look NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What would it be like to wear Google Glass? Google answered that very question this morning, posting a lot more information about Project Glass, including the user interface, through a series of photos and videos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can see the UI and some of the features of Glass in the gallery, although they don't quite capture the exact experience. The headset doesn't actually have lenses in front of your eyes, just a small screen (viewable via a mirrored glass block) above and to the right of the wearer's right eye. As such, the point-of-view images that show a large action window in the center of the field of view are a little misleading. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the photos, posted on Google's Project Glass website, show more about how Glass works than any photo of the hardware could convey. The video (below) shows even more: Commanding the headset is as easy as uttering the words ""OK, Glass,"" a clever use of real-world speech to engage the device's listening mode. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SEE ALSO: How Google Glass Could Change Advertising NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once engaged, Glass is capable of taking photos, recording videos, looking up answers on Google, showing reminders (such as for a flight) and sharing whatever you're looking at — either via messaging or through a Google+ Hangout. As Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself revealed previously, Glass will also have an automatic picture-taking mode, snapping pics at a preset intervals (such as every 5 seconds). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Google also launched a contest with its own hashtag (#ifihadglass), challenging anyone to come up with creative uses for Google Glass that can be explained in 50 words or fewer. Winners will get the chance to buy their own, along with developers, when they become available. The price: $1,500, plus tax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Are you impressed with how Google Glass works? Let us know in the comments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Images courtesy of Google  Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Google is letting a larger segment of the public test its futuristic eyeglasses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, Google said it was accepting applications for people who wanted to try the glasses, which had previously been available only to software developers who signed up for them at Google’s developer’s conference last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Google also released a few details about the glasses, which it calls Google Glass, some of which it had already publicized. They can take pictures or record video hands-free, show walking directions, search the Web and send messages by voice, offer translations and show alerts like a flight delay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People who want a pair of the glasses before they are publicly available must apply by Feb. 27 by writing a post on Google Plus or Twitter of 50 words or fewer with the hashtag #ifihadglass. Applicants can include photos or video and an explanation of what they might do with the glasses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re looking for bold, creative individuals who want to join us and be a part of shaping the future of Glass,” the company posted on Google Plus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those chosen by Google’s judges must pay $1,500 for the glasses and attend a pick-up event in New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a video released Wednesday, Google offered some of its own ideas about what to do with the glasses. A ballerina could stream live video behind the scenes and onstage, a tourist in Thailand could ask Google to translate “delicious” while eating noodles on a boat or a family could video chat with a long-distance relative on her birthday.","Google gave the public its first taste of how it would feel to strap on its much-anticipated digital glasses, releasing photos and a video showing off the system's capabilities and user interface. Users are shown taking video and photos, performing searches, and overlaying directions, weather, and flight info over their field of vision. The system is voice-controlled, activated with a cheerful, ""OK Glass,"" Mashable reports. The device will consist of a single, small screen, positioned over the user's right eye and visible via a mirrored glass block. Google also started taking applications for civilian beta testers, the New York Times reports—until now only developers could get their hands on it—though it will cost $1,500 and be available only to a select few. To apply, would-be early adopters need to post a 50-words-or-less application on Google+ or Twitter with the hashtag #ifihadglass. Those selected will have to pick up their headset in person at events in New York, LA, or San Francisco."

To take this into account, we use the following query: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PREFIX wd: < http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> PREFIX wdt: < http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> PREFIX rdfs: < http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> SELECT ?subject ?label ?coordinates (CONCAT(STR(DAY(?date)),""-"",STR(MONTH(?date)),""-"",STR(YEAR(?date))) as ?displaydate) (CONCAT(STR(DAY(?start)),""-"",STR(MONTH(?start)),""-"",STR(YEAR(?start))) as ?displaystart) (CONCAT(STR(DAY(?end)),""-"",STR(MONTH(?end)),""-"",STR(YEAR(?end))) as ?displayend) WHERE { ?subject wdt:P31 wd:Q178561 .

Eventually we gathered 2657 battles that have both a location and a date.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DBPedia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last Friday, we noticed the buzz around the #dbpediadenhaag event and the discussions about the data DBPedia has harvested from Wikipedia. So we queried the DBpedia sparql-endpoint to see what battles they have in store. We found 12674 instances of MilitaryConflict. Of these, 4022 have date and location properties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SELECT DISTINCT ?battle (SAMPLE(?dates) as ?date) ?location WHERE { ?battle rdf:type dbo:MilitaryConflict . ?battle dbo:date ?dates . ?battle georss:point ?location . } NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If we look a level deeper for dates and locations we get 10116 battles that have a place and a date reference. The dates are messier than the dates available through Wikidata (as these have been harvested), so a bit more clean up is required here to get a workable list. Once we’ve imported this into nodegoat, we get this result. We can also combine both sets (with a total of 12703 records). And highlight the provenance of each dot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the differences are a result of the messy dates in DBpedia. For example, compare dbp:date in this DBpedia record with the date in the infobox (which DPpedia harvests) of the original Wikipedia article. Other differences are due to the fact that we picked one location per battle and rounding of the latitude and longitude values. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Furthermore, we found that very little statements in Wikidata had a proper reference and most of them referenced only to ‘French Wikipedia’/‘English Wikipedia’ etc (which was already noted by this report). See this article on the overlaps/differences between Wikidata and DBpedia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Connecting the Dots NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once we had this up and running we checked what kind of objects relate to the events we found. There seems to be quite some data on the American Civil War in Wikidata, so we made a query to list the people who were present at the battles we identified earlier. This data allowed us to connect battles based on people who moved from one battle to another.

"Article Excerpt NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BOSTON—Extremist U.S. newspapers and other publications found in the apartment of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev reveal a broad interest in far-flung conspiracy theories, well beyond the Islamist radicalism authorities allege motivated the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Tsarnaev discovered some of the radical publications by chance. He had worked caring for a 67-year-old man who passed on the newspapers and his fringe beliefs long before Mr. Tsarnaev and his brother allegedly set off explosives that killed three people and injured hundreds more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tamerlan Tsarnaev was 26 years old when he died on April 19 in a firefight with police. His 19-year-old ...  Boston Marathon bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev befriended a brain-damaged anti-U.S. government conspiracy theorist through their mother's health care aide job years before the deadly attack, a lawyer said Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorney Jason Rosenberg, who represents the family of Donald Larking, said Larking shared publications with the brothers, especially Tamerlan, and discussed theories including that the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks and the Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school shooting didn't happen or the U.S. government was behind them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attorney said the Tsarnaev family had a relationship with the Larkings that started years ago when the brothers' mother began working as a personal care assistant for Larking's wife, a quadriplegic since birth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenberg said Larking, who lives in West Newton, just west of Boston, was shot in the head in 1974 in an attempted robbery while working in a convenience store. He said Larking suffered brain damage that led to problems with his decision-making and judgment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers orchestrated the April 15 marathon bombing, in which two pressure cookers loaded with shrapnel exploded near the race's finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty last month to charges including using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police a few days after the bombing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenberg said Tuesday the Tsarnaev brothers got to know Larking while substituting for their mother sometimes by helping to care for his wife. The attorney said the brothers ""were very helpful, very kind"" to the couple and Larking shared his views with them as he found anti-U.S. government websites and became angrier and irrational. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attorney said Larking, who has many Jewish friends, also has literature that questions if the Holocaust happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawyer's account first emerged in a Wall Street Journal article, which included Tamerlan Tsarnaev's former landlady talking about publications that had been in his Cambridge apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Landlady Joanna Herlihy told The Associated Press she salvaged publications after authorities had finished searching the apartment and items were discarded. She confirmed that among them were an Alabama-based publication that uses a Confederate flag on its website and a weekly publication that the Southern Poverty Law Center calls anti-Semitic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenberg said Tuesday he doesn't think Larking helped the Tsarnaev brothers, ethnic Chechens from Russia, formulate ideas but may have made them believe others felt as they did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""(They) were seeing someone who was Caucasian and was born in America who was saying the same things,"" the attorney said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenberg said he doesn't know if the Tsarnaev brothers understood how seriously Larking's brain was affected from the long-ago shooting. He said he's talked to Larking since the Boston Marathon bombing but doesn't think his friend comprehends what happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The brothers took Larking to their mosque, and he converted to Islam and still attends the mosque, Rosenberg said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Larking seemed close to Tamerlan, and Tamerlan made sure to help Larking, who wears braces on his legs, when they attended the mosque together, said Nicole Mossalam, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mossalam said it becomes obvious during conversation that Larking has a disability because he's unusually open and ""childlike"" and often says politically incorrect things without seeming to realize it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""He loves to sit down with people and talk, and there's basically no filter,"" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a federal indictment in June, authorities alleged they found on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's computer a publication written by someone known as the Father of Global Jihad that advocates violence to terrorize Islam's perceived enemies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors also alleged he downloaded an article from a publication that ""glorifies martyrdom in the service of violent jihad"" and a magazine that had directions for building bombs using pressure cookers.","Did a brain-damaged American help turn the Boston bombing suspects against the US? The far-right and conspiracy theorist publications found in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's apartment appear to have been supplied by an elderly man befriended by the brothers through their mother's job as a home health aide, the Wall Street Journal finds. A lawyer for the family of Donald Larking, a 67-year-old who suffered brain damage when he was shot in a robbery 40 years ago, says Larking was obsessed with conspiracy theories and shared publications with the brothers that questioned the Holocaust and accused the US or Israeli governments of being behind 9/11 and the Newtown school shooting. Larking also supplied the brothers with copies of a white supremacist newspaper published in Alabama. He became so close to Tamerlan that he converted to Islam and began attending the local mosque with him, says the lawyer, who stresses that the shooting badly impaired the elderly man's ""awareness of the realities of the world"" and his ability to make decisions, the AP reports. Larking, who still attends the mosque, has sunk into ""depression and anger"" since the Boston Marathon bombing and believes his friends were the victims of another conspiracy, the lawyer says."
"Roseanne is going home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two decades after the iconic family sitcom signed off the air, ABC has announced that they've handed out a straight-to-series order for a revival, bringing the Connor clan back to the network that made them household names. Network president Channing Dungey confirmed the plans for the new episodes while on a conference call with reporters ahead of ABC's big presentation during 2017 Upfronts week in New York City. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We're rebooting Roseanne,"" she said. ""It is planned for the midseason. We're still at the early stages."" Per the network's press release, the eight-episode revival will find the Connors continuing to deal with ""the economic challenges of living pay check to pay check in 2018.""  The reboot, which will feature returning stars Roseanne Barr and John Goodman among others, is set to air midseason. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's official: Roseanne is returning to ABC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The network has handed out an eight-episode straight-to-series order for a revival of the wildly popular family sitcom headlined by comedian Roseanne Barr. The reboot will debut sometime midseason on the network. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We're rebooting Roseanne,"" ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said Tuesday during pre-upfronts call with reporters. The series will return midseason, with a formal date to be announced later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Original castmembers Roseanne Barr, John Goodman (despite the fact that his character Dan died of a heart attack during the final season), Sara Gilbert (Darlene), Laurie Metcalf (Jackie), Michael Fishman (D.J.) and Lecy Goranson (Becky) are all set to return. Sarah Chalke, who played the role of Becky after Goranson, will also return, but in a different role. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Conners’ joys and struggles are as relevant — and hilarious — today as they were then, and there’s really no one better to comment on our modern America than Roseanne,” Dungey said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pickup comes almost 20 years after the Emmy-winning multicam went off the air. The revival will again be a multicamera comedy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revival sparked interest from several potential buyers including Netflix, which has revived Full House, Arrested Development and Gilmore Girls. The Roseanne revival was spearheaded by Gilbert, who currently hosts and exec produces the CBS daytime show The Talk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gilbert joins original exec producers Barr, Tom Werner and Bruce Helford. Whitney Cummings and Tony Hernandez also exec produce. Like the original series, independent studio Carsey-Werner Television will produce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roseanne centered on the working-class Conner family in Illinois and ran on ABC from 1988-97. At its peak, Roseanne ranked as the top series on television during the 1989-90 season and drew nearly 17 million viewers for its final episode. The series has continued to air in reruns on TV Land, CMT and Logo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pickup comes as networks, including ABC, have worked hard to better appeal to working-class middle America in the wake of Donald Trump's stunning defeat over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. ""[The election] made the ground shake underneath media,"" TLC president Nancy Daniels told THR in December, ""and now everybody is taking a hard look: Are we telling the right stories? Are we reaching the right people?"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roseanne is just the latest in a long line of revivals that includes NBC's Will & Grace, as well as 24, Prison Break and The X-Files — which will return with another 10 episodes in 2018 — on Fox. ABC's cult beloved mystery Twin Peaks is also getting the revival treatment, albeit on Showtime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roseanne will be one of two revivals on the Disney-owned broadcaster. The network beat out NBC and Fox to resurrect American Idol only a year after Fox opted to cancel the singing competition. On the unscripted, ABC has also found success with revivals of game shows like Match Game and $100,000 Pyramid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roseanne's straight-to-series pickup will be ABC's lone multicamera comedy on its 2017-18 schedule. ABC recently canceled Last Man Standing and Dr. Ken — its only multicamera shows. The Disney-owned network will start the fall 2017-18 season without a single multicamera comedy on its schedule as pilot Household Name, starring Carol Burnett, is being redeveloped. The format, however, remains popular on CBS, which is home to Big Bang Theory, Mom, Kevin Can Wait, Superior Donuts and Man With a Plan. (Both Big Bang and Mom are executive produced by former Roseanne writer Chuck Lorre.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the Will & Grace revival, launching in the fall, NBC has The Carmichael Show and Marlon, both of which are being held for summer. Fox has been out of the multicam business for a few seasons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's the full original cast reunited at ABC's upfront:","Roseanne's return to TV has been confirmed, 20 years to the week after the beloved sitcom's final episode aired.

The network says the reboot will feature Roseanne's original cast, including Roseanne Barr, Sara Gilbert, and John Goodman, despite the fact that Goodman's character, dad Dan Conner, died during the show's final season. Barr and Gilbert will be among the executive producers of the show, which won 17 Emmys during its nine-season run. Laurie Metcalf, Michael Fishman, and Lecy Goranson will also be back as Jackie, DJ, and Becky. ""The Conners' joys and struggles are as relevant—and hilarious—today as they were then, and there's really no one better to comment on our modern America than Roseanne,"" ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said in a statement.

"What was supposed to be routine surgery became a little too routine for 43-year-old William McCormack, who is suing Lawrence Hospital Center, claiming that he had to have an appendectomy in the Adirondacks last month — a year after he supposedly had the same operation at the Bronxville medical facility.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What was supposed to be routine surgery became a little too routine for 43-year-old William McCormack, who is suing Lawrence Hospital Center, claiming that he had to have an appendectomy in the Adirondacks last month — a year after he supposedly had the same operation at the Bronxville medical facility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCormack, a Bronxville resident, is seeking unspecified damages from Lawrence Hospital and Dr. Michael Kerin, the Tuckahoe surgeon who said he removed McCormack's appendix on Jan. 27, 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court, McCormack says that he experienced severe stomach pains during a visit to Lake Placid in early March. He went to Adirondack Medical Center in Saranac Lake and underwent an emergency operation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the second operation, ""it was discovered that (McCormack's) appendix was never removed and was still inside him,"" court papers say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kerin, who runs Michael Kerin MD, General Surgery & Med Spa in Tuckahoe, did not return calls seeking comment. His website lists Kerin as former director of surgery at Lawrence Hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hospital told The Journal News in an email that it was investigating McCormack's claim and does not comment on pending litigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitchell J. Baker, the White Plains lawyer representing McCormack, had no comment, saying only that the lawsuit ""speaks for itself."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Included in the lawsuit is a copy of a Jan. 27, 2013 Operative Report from Lawrence Hospital stating that McCormack's appendix had been removed.

The now 43-year-old underwent surgery and was told his appendix was removed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About a year after his surgery, McCormack was in upstate New York when he started to feel those same stomach pains. When doctors examined him, they discovered that he still had his appendix.

The lawsuit claims what was actually removed from McCormack was a ""yellowish mass,"" not his appendix. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His attorney says documents show the hospital and the doctor, Michael Kerin, realized the mistake and carelessly ignored it. McCormack is asking to be compensated not just for the pain and suffering, but also for having to go under the knife twice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorney Mitchell Baker says the hospital and surgeon may have been faced with more than medical malpractice had McCormack’s appendix not been removed upstate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Calls for comment have not been returned by Lawrence Hospital.","When William McCormack went into a medical center in the Adirondacks last month with severe stomach pains, he ended up getting an emergency appendectomy ... which came as quite a surprise to him, considering he thought he'd already had his appendix removed in Bronxville, New York, last year.

McCormack was on vacation near Lake Placid in early March when he had to undergo emergency surgery, during which surgeons ""discovered that (McCormack's) appendix was never removed and was still inside him,"" according to his lawsuit. Also included in the suit: a copy of the post-op report from Lawrence Hospital, which is signed by Kerin and claims McCormack's appendix had indeed been removed. It's not clear how exactly the hospital failed to alert McCormack he was still in possession of the body part, as a report from the pathology department states, ""there is no evidence of appendix"" in the specimen marked ""appendix."" So what was removed from McCormack's body? A ""yellowish mass,"" according to News 12."
"Ryan Adams' 2014 self-titled album was one of the more downcast, melancholic LPs in the singer-songwriter's vast catalog. While much of Ryan Adams' moodier tone was likely the result of his struggle with the debilitating Ménière's disease and the death of his grandmother, this too perhaps informed his latest album: Ryan Adams and Mandy Moore announced they are divorcing after nearly six years of marriage.

Moore also contributed background vocals to Adams' 2011 album Ashes & Fire and Ryan Adams' ""Trouble"" and ""Am I Safe."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, for the most part, Adams and Moore kept their marriage out of the headlines.

"When George Talley’s 1979 Corvette was stolen more than three decades ago in Detroit, he thought it was gone for good. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apparently not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, the silver sports car was found in Mississippi. And after hearing Talley’s story on the radio this morning, General Motors, his former employer, offered to pick up the Corvette and deliver it to him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michigan State Police Lt. Michael A. Shaw said via e-mail Wednesday afternoon the car was recovered after the Michigan Southwest Commercial Auto Recovery unitwas contacted by the Secretary of State regarding two 1979 Corvettes. The Secretary of State said an individual tried to register the vehicles under the same VIN number. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “SCAR identified the first one in the Holland area back in October,” Shaw said. “The second vehicle recently resurfaced in the state of Mississippi.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mississippi Bureau of Investigation officials said the car was located at a residence in Columbia, Miss. “The investigation is ongoing regarding the vehicle’s history and whereabouts during the past three decades,” the MBI said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shaw said SCAR worked with the Mississippi police and the National Insurance Crime Bureau to trace the vehicle back to Talley. The investigation revealed that Talley’s claim was never paid by his insurance and he remains the owner of the car. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Talley said when he received an initial phone call from his insurance company notifying him that the car was found, he thought it was a joke. But when the Michigan State Police called, he couldn’t believe his luck. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I said, ‘This isn’t no joke. They wouldn’t be joking with me because I don’t think they have time to play with me,’” Talley said. “I was shocked.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The last time Talley, now 71 and retired in Detroit, saw his beloved car was when it was parked on Jefferson Avenue in July 1981. Then the car disappeared. Talley reported the incident to police, but never thought he’d see his car again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Talley said he’s a Corvette lover and has owned four different models. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They looked into it, but didn’t recover it and nothing happened and 33 years passed,” Talley said. “It was a great thing that the MSP and Mississippi State troopers, they did their job and found it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ■ Related: Stolen Mustang returns home, 20 years later NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ■ Related: Last Corvette retrieved from museum sinkhole NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Talley was told the car still runs, has 47,000 miles on it and is at the Hattiesburg police station. But he was concerned about how he would fetch it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I woke up this morning,” Talley said during an interview with Paul W. Smith on WJR Wednesday. “I said, ‘I’ve got to get on the phone and find a trucker or somebody to bring it back’ — or go get it or something.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, GM’s Executive Vice President Mark Reuss had heard the radio segment and offered to pick up Talley’s car. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I listened to you this morning,” Reuss said on the show. “We just had to do something.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Talley, who said he worked at GM’s Milford Proving Grounds, was happy to hear the news. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was worried,” he said, referring to how he was going to get the car back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Well,” Smith told him. “Nothing to worry about now. The Corvette is on its way safe and sound.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Talley said GM told him they would notify him within the next few days to let him know when the car will arrive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “GM is paying for all of that, which is beautiful,” Talley said.  (WXYZ) - When George Talley tells an old story, there’s a good chance he’ll mention his old rides. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I’ve always liked Corvettes. It was attractive. The ladies like ‘em,” said George. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But so did the thieves, and George learned that the hard way. The last time he saw his ‘79 Corvette, it was parked on Jefferson Avenue 33 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I made a police report, and I haven’t seen it since July of 1981,” said George. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR George often wondered about the one that got away. That is until recently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I was sitting at home last Friday looking at Judge Mathis, and I get a call from AAA telling me you have a Corvette in Mississippi, come and get it. And, uh… I said, ‘what?’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say a dubious vin number helped track the Vette three decades later. And the car is still in pretty good shape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I’ve heard it was running, it had 47,000 miles on it, and right now, it’s at the police station in Hattiesburg,” said George. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of Tuesday it’s still up in the air whether George would ship it or bring the car back himself. That all changed Wednesday morning when General Motor's Executive Vice President, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain Mark Reuss announced that he was offering to bring the Vette home - at GM's expense. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The offer came during The Paul W. Smith show on News/Talk 760 AM WJR radio. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It’s a lucky day. When I get that car here in that driveway, we’ll go from there,” said George, before learning of the offer.","Last time George Talley saw his beloved 1979 Corvette, it was parked on Jefferson Avenue in Detroit in the summer of 1981, reports WXYZ. He'd long ago given up hope of ever getting the stolen car back, but then came a call out of the blue from authorities in Mississippi who found it via a false VIN number. Better yet, it seems to be in decent shape, with only 47,000 miles. Talley, now 71 and still the rightful owner, told the tale on a Detroit radio station today, his only lament being that he had to figure out how to get the car shipped to Michigan. Enter GM exec Mark Reuss, who happened to catch the show, reports the Detroit Free Press. The company is going to pick up the car for its former employee and ship it back free of charge.

"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — A Missouri appeals court judge was appointed Monday to take over Ferguson's municipal court and make ""needed reforms"" after a highly critical U.S. Department of Justice report that was prompted by the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Missouri Supreme Court said it is assigning state appeals Judge Roy L. Richter to hear all of Ferguson's pending and future municipal court cases. The high court said Richter also will have the authority to overhaul court policies to ensure defendants' rights are respected and to ""restore the integrity of the system."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ferguson Municipal Judge Ronald J. Brockmeyer resigned Monday, saying through a spokesman that he was stepping down to promote public confidence in the court and help Ferguson ""begin its healing process."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Ferguson City Council met in closed session Monday evening, but members left without taking questions and a city spokesman didn't disclose the purpose of the meeting. Ferguson City Manager John Shaw was escorted to his vehicle by a police officer without fielding questions, and Mayor James Knowles III declined comment to The Associated Press afterward except to say that the city on Tuesday would begin seeking Brockmeyer's permanent successor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Richter will take charge of the court on March 16. The Supreme Court said it also is assigning staff from the state court administrator's office to aid Richter in reviewing Ferguson's municipal court practices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Judge Richter will bring a fresh, disinterested perspective to this court's practices, and he is able and willing to implement needed reforms,"" Chief Justice Mary Russell said in a written statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Extraordinary action is warranted in Ferguson, but the Court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis,"" Russell added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The change comes after the Justice Department released a report last week that cited cases of racial profiling and bigotry by police and chided what it described as a profit-driven municipal court system in the predominantly black St. Louis suburb where Brown, 18, was shot by a white Ferguson police officer on Aug. 9. The shooting prompted protests in the St. Louis area and across the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department both declined to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson, who resigned from the department. The Justice Department report said Wilson acted in self-defense when he shot Brown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the Justice Department said Ferguson's police and court systems functioned as a money-making enterprise that heightened tensions among residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The federal report noted that Ferguson was counting on revenues from fines and fees to generate $3.1 million, or nearly one-quarter of its total $13.3 million budget for the 2015 fiscal year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although it was rare for the court to sentence people to jail as a penalty for city code violations, the Justice Department report said the city's court almost always imposes monetary penalties and then issues arrest warrants when people fail to pay on time or miss a court date. As a result, relatively minor violations can — and frequently do — lead to arrests and jail time, the report said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The federal report also cited several instances in which Ferguson's municipal judge, court clerk or city prosecutor helped ""fix"" tickets for colleagues and friends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report cited the forgiven tickets for Ferguson officials as evidence of ""a double standard grounded in racial stereotyping."" It said Ferguson officials displayed ""a striking lack of personal responsibility among themselves"" while some nonetheless asserted to federal investigators that the city's African-American residents lacked ""personal responsibility."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorney Bert Fulk said in a statement announcing Brockmeyer's resignation that Brockmeyer had been ""fair and impartial"" as a part-time judge and that the court clerk bore the primary responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city fired court clerk Mary Ann Twitty last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon released a written statement Monday praising the ""strong and appropriate actions by the Missouri Supreme Court"" to overhaul the Ferguson municipal court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Monday's appointment of a new Ferguson judge drew mixed reviews among a dozen onlookers at that night's council meeting. Derrick Robinson, a protest organizer, said the move was ""letting us know they're hearing our cry, and I think it's a good step in reconstructing Ferguson."" Meldon Moffitt, of St. Louis, countered that it wouldn't make anything better, adding ""the only way we can clean up Ferguson is to wipe out the police force, wipe out the courts and wipe out the judges.""

Lieb at: https://twitter.com/DavidALieb NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Associated Press writers Jim Suhr and Jim Salter contributed to this report from Ferguson.  In the first session since the Missouri Supreme Court took over Ferguson's municipal court, Judge Roy L. Richter began with a detailed overview of the state's court system, and then announced he was lowering some of the fines.","The Missouri Supreme Court is helping with the housecleaning in Ferguson: The court says that to ""restore public trust and confidence"" in the municipal court division, it's taking the ""extraordinary action"" of reassigning all municipal court cases to a state appeals court judge, reports the New York Times. Ronald Brockmeyer, the Ferguson judge who doubles up as a prosecutor, resigned from both roles yesterday. The 70-year-old tells the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he doesn't agree with a Justice Dept. report on the biased and ""abusive"" practices he allegedly played a key role in, including the ""creative"" use of fines and fees to raise money for the city, ""but it's not worth fighting."" The top Missouri court says it's assigning Judge Roy L. Richter to hear pending and future cases in Ferguson, and the appeals court judge will also have the power to ""restore the integrity of the system"" with a revamp of municipal policies, reports the AP. The court says it is also looking at statewide reforms. St. Louis University law professor Brendan Roediger tells the Times that this is the first case he knows of where a state court has taken over an entire municipal docket. ""It's a very big deal because it actually is the solution,"" he says. ""It puts the cases in front of full-time professional courts with no conflicts of interest."""

Ever get annoyed by people on social media who share 'profound' quotes, or use meaningless, intelligent-sounding soundbites in arguments? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A new study has shown that there is a link between these people and low intelligence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It found that those who are receptive to pseudo-profound, intellectual-sounding 'bulls***' are less intelligent, less reflective, and more likely to be believe in conspiracy theories, the paranormal and alternative medicine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PhD candidate Gordon Pennycook and a team of researchers from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, published a study entitled 'On the reception and detection of pseudo-profound bulls***'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It mentions the word 'bulls***' over 200 times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They tested hundreds of people to find the link between being impressed by 'bulls***' quotes and low intelligence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Examples of 'bulls***' were given, as it is a hard term to define. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Essentially, it means grand-sounding statements which mean nothing - many people post such things on Instagram. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An example was: ""Hidden meaning transforms unparalleled abstract beauty."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The paper says: ""Although this statement may seem to convey some sort of potentially profound meaning, it is merely a collection of buzzwords put together randomly in a sentence that retains syntactic structure."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Bulls***, in contrast to mere nonsense, is something that implies but does not contain adequate meaning or truth."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pennycook used a website that would randomly generate these pseudo-profound sentences from a string of words. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This website is active, and serves up wise-sounding aphorisms like ""This life is nothing short of an unveiling quantum leap of mythic rejuvenation"" and ""We are at a crossroads of transformation and desire"" at the click of a button. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Almost 300 test subjects were asked to rate the profundity of these sentences on a scale of one to five. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They were asked to differentiate between philosophy quotes, ""bulls***"", and mundane sentences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most recognised the mundane as mundane, but rated the made-up quotes on similar levels of profoundity to tweets posted by Deepak Chopra, a writer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR OK ? ?? A photo posted by @24january_ on Dec 3, 2015 at 4:56am PST NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As well as this. he researchers looked into a number of other personality traits, examining how the participants think about themselves and the world around them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The paper said that those who were more receptive to the bulls*** statements and who tended to rate them higher were ""less reflective, lower in cognitive ability(i.e verbal and fluid intelligence, numeracy,) and are more prone to ontological confusions and conspiratorial ideation."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also said they were more likely to ""hold religious and paranormal beliefs, and are more likely to endorse complementary and alternative medicine."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As they say, ""our findings are consistent with the idea that the tendency to rate vague, meaningless statements as profound is a legitimate psychological phenomenon that is consistently related to at least some variables of theoretical interest.""","This has to rank among the best opening statements ever in a study abstract: ""Although bullshit is common in everyday life and has attracted attention from philosophers, its reception (critical or ingenuous) has not, to our knowledge, been subject to empirical investigation."" And so researchers at the University of Waterloo in Ontario set out to study ""pseudo-profound bullshit,"" and who believes it. Reporting in the journal Judgment and Decision Making, the researchers asked subjects to rate quotes that are philosophical, mundane, or simply BS—the latter consisting, in their words, of ""seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous""—on a profundity scale. The team also tested participants' cognitive and reasoning ability. The researchers found that those who are ""more receptive"" to BS have lower ""verbal and fluid intelligence"" and are more likely to believe in the paranormal, conspiracy theories, and alternative medicine. For actual examples of readily propagated BS, Forbes reports PhD candidate Gordon Pennycook and his team turned to the Twitter feed of Deepak Chopra, highlighting tweets such as ""Attention and intention are the mechanics of manifestation."" The Telegraph reports the researchers also used this website, which composes made-up pseudo-profound statements like this one: ""Growth is the richness of life, and of us."" The researchers found that participants assigned the website-generated BS and Chopra's tweets similar profoundness ratings. As for who was good at sniffing out BS, Forbes reports it was those who tend to ""have an analytic cognitive style and be skeptical about paranormal phenomena."" Chopra's response to it all? He tweeted, ""I thank the authors for the study. Their # bullshit is getting me more speaking engagements & new book offers.""

"A flying snake flattens out into a weird flying-saucer shape in order to get some extra airtime, new research suggests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The findings, published today (Jan. 29) in The Journal of Experimental Biology, show that the Southeast Asian snake's flattened, UFO-like cross-section gives it the right aerodynamic properties for gliding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The shape is unusual,"" said study co-author Jake Socha, a biomechanics researcher at Virginia Tech. ""You never find this kind of shape in any other animal flyer; you don't find it in engineered flyers. We didn't know if that was a good shape to have."" [See Images of the Flying Snake] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gliding animals NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The weird flying snake, Chrysopelea paradisi, curls its tail around a tree branch more than 50 feet (15 meters) above the ground before launching upward, curling its body and gliding to the next tree limb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While birds, and even humans using glider wings, are much better at their airborne maneuvers, the snake's performance compares favorably to that of other gliding animals, such as flying squirrels, lizards and even ants, Socha said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers already knew that the snakes curved around, splayed out their ribs to flatten their bodies and undulated as they were airborne — but they didn't know why. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It looks like it's swimming in the air,"" Socha told LiveScience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No snake-shaped planes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To answer one part of the puzzle, the team created physical models of the cross-section and tested them in a water tunnel, which, if set up properly, can have the same flow characteristics as air, Socha said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It turned out that the flying saucer cross-section was a surprisingly good shape to take — much better than the cylindrical shape the snake would have if it didn't compress itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Compared to a more familiar flying shape, such as an airplane wing scaled down to snake size, ""you'd find the snake is actually comparable,"" Socha said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The animal has figured out a solution to an engineering problem that we didn't even know we had,"" Socha said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But don't expect to board a 747 with flying-snake-shaped wings anytime soon, as the shape wouldn't be nearly as aerodynamically effective at a plane's size and speed, Socha said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, the team has to solve another mystery: why the snake undulates once or twice every second while gliding, Socha said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+. Follow LiveScience @livescience, Facebook & Google+. Original article on LiveScience.  By Charles Q. Choi NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snakes don’t need to be on a plane to fly: Five species of the gliding reptiles can soar as far as 100 feet (30 meters) in the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now scientists have discovered the secret behind how these snakes stay airborne—they twist their bodies into an S shape that resembles an alien’s flying saucer from the side. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists already knew that flying snakes climb up trees by using ridges on their belly scales to help grip bark as they slither upward, and that when the animals glide downward, they undulate from side to side. (Related: “How Snakes Can ‘Fly.’”) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These movements—done by flexing the ribs—transform the serpent’s body into a totally aerodynamic surface, according to biomechanist Jake Socha, of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, and his colleagues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As frightening as the idea of a 4-foot (1.2-meter) flying snake might be to some, these mildly venomous reptiles are harmful only to small prey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists don’t know how often or exactly why flying snakes fly, but it’s likely they use their aerobatics to escape predators, to move from tree to tree without having to descend to the forest floor, and possibly even to hunt prey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watch a video of a flying snake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clues From 3-D Printing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To learn more about the aerodynamic forces the snakes generate, Socha and his colleagues used a 3-D printer, which works by depositing layers on top of layers to create 3-D objects. (Related: “Improving 3-D Printing by Copying Nature.”) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers printed a 3-D rod with a UFO-like cross section that mimicked the body of the paradise tree snake (Chrysopelea paradisi), the most proficient snake glider. The team then placed the rod within a tank of water that flowed over it, re-creating the air conditions the reptiles experience as they glide through the forest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scientists tilted the rod at various angles as water flowed over it at different speeds, and measured how the current moved the rod up or down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The results, published January 29 in the Journal of Experimental Biology, showed that at most angles, the snake model’s undulating shape generated enough lift to account for the animal’s gliding ability. (See more snake pictures.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers added that real flying snakes appear to glide even better than their findings from the 3-D printed model would suggest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They are now investigating what else these reptiles might do to boost their aerial performances. As it is, these serpents remain somewhat Unexplained Flying Ophidians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Charles Q. Choi on Twitter and Google+.","Researchers think they've at long last solved, at least partially, the mystery of so-called ""flying snakes."" The five species of Chrysopelea don't actually fly, but they're impressive gliders, capable of sailing up to 100 feet through the air. Until now, scientists didn't know how they managed it, but now they think they do: As the snakes jump, they flatten out their ribs and contort themselves into an S-shape that sorta kinda resembles a flying saucer, LiveScience reports. ""You never find this kind of shape in any other animal flyer; you don't find it in engineered flyers,"" says one study co-author. ""We didn't know if that was a good shape to have."" The snake's body develops a curve a little like an airplane wing, the BBC explains, which coupled with its undulating movements generates lift. Researchers hit on the discovery using 3D-printed models in tanks of water, National Geographic reports. But observations of real snakes indicate that they're even better gliders than the model suggested, meaning some aspect of their prowess remains unexplained.

(AP Photo/J.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Funding for the wall — a top Trump priority — and legal protections for so-called Dreamers, a key Democratic goal, should not be linked, Pelosi said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""They're two different subjects,"" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her comments came as the House and Senate approved a stopgap bill Thursday to keep the government funded through Dec. 21. The measure, approved by voice votes in near-empty chambers, now goes to the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has promised to sign the two-week extension to allow for ceremonies this week honoring former President George H.W. Bush, who died Nov. 30. But he wants the next funding package to include at least $5 billion for his proposed wall, something Democrats have rejected. Trump is set to meet Tuesday at the White House with Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a tweet late Thursday, Trump warned of the potential for ""Big danger"" at the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, demanding, ""Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall!"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pelosi, who is seeking to become House speaker in January, said the lame-duck Congress should now pass a half-dozen government funding bills that key committees have already agreed on, along with a separate measure funding the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the border. Funding for the homeland agency should address border security and does not necessarily include a wall, Pelosi said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most Democrats consider the wall ""immoral, ineffective and expensive,"" Pelosi said, noting that Trump promised during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for it, an idea Mexican leaders have repeatedly rejected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even if Mexico did pay for the wall, ""it's immoral still,"" Pelosi said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The one and only way we approach a shutdown is if President Trump refuses both of our proposals and demands $5 billion or more for a border wall,"" Schumer said.

Funding for the wall—a top Trump priority—and legal protections for so-called Dreamers, a key Democratic goal, should not be linked, Pelosi said. ""They're two different subjects,"" and most Democrats consider the wall ""immoral, ineffective, and expensive,"" Pelosi said. Her comments came as the House and Senate approved a stopgap bill Thursday to keep the government funded through Dec. 21, the AP reports. The measure, approved by voice votes in near-empty chambers, now goes to the White House. Trump has promised to sign the two-week extension to allow for ceremonies this week honoring former President George HW Bush, who died Nov. 30. But he wants the next funding package to include at least $5 billion for his proposed wall, something Democrats have rejected.

She was released on $50,000 bail. If convicted, she faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sylvia, 58, of Somers Point, was introduced to the undercover agent by a patient with past connections to an unspecified ""organized criminal gang,"" an FBI agent wrote in a criminal complaint, after she told the patient in September of her desire for revenge.

"JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s biggest bank, will provide $100 million to help debt-ridden Detroit with housing repairs, blight removal, job training and economic development projects over the next five years, according to two people with direct knowledge of the plans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investment, a mix of loans and grants, will add to a growing pile of money from outside private institutions as the city nears the final, painful stages of the nation’s largest municipal bankruptcy proceeding. Detroit filed for bankruptcy protection in July, with an estimated $18 billion in long-term debt. This summer, a federal judge will decide whether to approve a plan that would allow the city to exit bankruptcy court by mid-October. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent days, the city has been lobbying to secure nearly $200 million in funding from Michigan lawmakers, who are wary of setting a precedent by using taxpayer dollars to bail out a major metropolis. If approved, the state funding would be part of a so-called grand bargain that would also include hundreds of millions of dollars from philanthropic foundations. The money would be used to cushion pension cuts for Detroit retirees and avert the sale of the city’s art collection. The Legislature is weighing a package of bills regarding the outside funding this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JPMorgan’s support, previously reported by Detroit newspapers, will focus on city revitalization efforts and may help ease concerns by some legislators that Detroit could find itself in financial trouble again down the road. The institution’s chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, will make a public announcement about the money with state and city officials on Wednesday. A spokesman for the bank would not discuss the matter before then. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The city’s challenges remain significant — unprecedented, in some regards — but JPMorgan Chase believes that Detroit has the ingredients and intrinsic strengths to reshape and rebuild a dynamic modern economy and make the city a great place to live, work and invest,” said a company document detailing how the $100 million would be spent, which The Detroit Free Press posted online on Tuesday. “We are committed to helping make that future a reality.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bank will direct half of the money to community projects that would otherwise lack access to capital. It will put $25 million toward assisting groups like the Detroit Land Bank Authority and the Detroit Blight Removal Task Force, which have begun aggressive demolition campaigns to rid the city of its estimated 78,000 vacant structures. The rest will be diced up: $12.5 million for work-force training, $7 million for small-business assistance and $5.5 million toward economic growth projects such as a new streetcar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company announced another five-year initiative in December that infused $250 million into Detroit and other big cities for job-skills training. Both efforts come as JPMorgan emerges from a period of intense scrutiny. The bank reached a $13 billion settlement in November over its sale of questionable mortgage securities in the prelude to the financial crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goldman Sachs, another bank that has been buffeted by regulatory woes, pledged $20 million to Detroit in November for job creation and economic development.  When the head of the world's largest bank called the local billionaire bent on Detroit's revival, good things happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon plans to be in Detroit today to announce a $100-million investment in the city that began several months ago with a phone call to billionaire Dan Gilbert, the Quicken Loans founder who owns or controls more than 40 downtown buildings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Obviously, Detroit was having issues,"" Dimon told the Free Press this week in an exclusive interview. ""I got together some of our senior people and said, 'What can we do that's really neat, that could be really ...","JPMorgan is moving to help a bankrupt city get back on its feet. The bank is putting $100 million, divided between loans and grants, toward Detroit's revitalization, the New York Times reports. The money is intended to help the city with an array of projects, including housing improvements, the demolition of some 70,000 empty buildings, and job training. ""I think we can make this our finest moment,"" CEO Jamie Dimon told the Today show. Dimon rejects the idea that the bank's move has anything to do with a $13 billion settlement last year tied to the financial crisis. ""We invest and develop communities around the world … That's what banks do."" The effort began several months ago when Dimon contacted Quicken Loans boss Dan Gilbert, who has a large stake in downtown buildings, the Detroit Free Press reports. ""No one’s forcing them to do this by any means,"" Gilbert says. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, for his part, calls the money a ""significant start."" Dimon's goal with the funding: ""If it works, you'll have a healthy and vibrant economy, jobs and population, businesses will beget home ownership, better schools, and a completely revived city."""

"WASHINGTON -- Matt Roberts stood in a corner of the State Dining Room at the White House on Monday, showing samples of his company's Liberty Tabletop stainless steel silverware, when Rep. Claudia Tenney rushed over with a spoon in her hand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roberts, president of Sherrill Manufacturing, the Upstate New York firm that's America's last flatware maker, looked closely at the spoon with the eye of an experienced craftsman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tenney, R-New Hartford, asked if he could make out the brand and where it was made. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It says Oneida Ltd.,"" Roberts said, shaking his head in disappointment. ""It's made in China."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tenney had just taken the spoon off a table where the White House served refreshments at its annual ""Made in America Product Showcase."" President Donald Trump established the annual event to show off American-made products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tenney and dozens of members of Congress, titans of American industry and members of Trump's cabinet used the foreign-made silverware at Monday's event. Oneida Ltd., once based in Central New York, now sells products made overseas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tenney and Sherrill Manufacturing have tried for months to convince the Trump White House to buy the American-made silverware. There's even bipartisan support. U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked Trump when he took office to buy the Liberty Tabletop utensils for state dinners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In November, Tenney cornered Trump at the Capitol after he lobbied Republican members of Congress to vote for a bill overhauling the U.S. tax code. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I'll buy it, I'll buy it,"" Trump promised Tenney in an exchange recorded on video on her cell phone. ""Done!"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Greg Owens, co-founder and CEO of Sherrill Manufacturing, said a member of the White House hospitality staff approached him and Roberts at Monday's event and expressed interest in their product, including their patriotic Betsy Ross line of silverware. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he has been through this before. A White House official called Owens after Trump's November promise, but Owens said he never heard back from the administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roberts said he understood why the company might not be a priority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""With all of the things going on in the world, forks and spoons in your kitchen are not exactly the top priority at the White House,"" Roberts said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Owens said he was told by a White House aide later Monday that Trump had seen the Liberty Tabletop flatware during a private tour of the State Dining Room after it had been cleared of guests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Apparently he pointed it out and said, 'I want this stuff in the White House.' So I'm expecting a phone call or email in the next couple of days,"" Owens said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Roberts and Owens are former Oneida Ltd. executives who bought the company's plant in the Oneida County city of Sherrill for $1 million on March 22, 2005 and reopened it the next day as Sherrill Manufacturing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oneida Ltd., which once employed 2,500 people producing 3.5 million forks, knives and spoons a week, no longer manufactures in the United States. But Sherrill Manufacturing has managed to find a niche, selling its Liberty Tabletop brand directly to consumers through its website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Owens said Monday that the company has continued to grow since Trump invited Sherrill Manufacturing to the White House in July 2017. Production has increased 33 percent, employment has grown from 42 to 54, and net income is expected to eclipse $5 million this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company has increased its sales to the federal government this year, with big orders from the Navy and State Department for its embassies, Owens said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among those to stop by the Liberty Tabletop display at the White House on Monday were two of Trump's most influential economic advisers -- Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, the president's top trade adviser. Neither one was familiar with the brand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a White House military aide stopped by and told Roberts the flatware looked familiar. The woman had served on the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Well, you've probably used our flatware,"" Roberts said. ""We supplied the ship.""

Claudia Tenney that he will buy Made in USA flatware from the last remaining producer in the United States, Sherrill Manufacturing of Upstate New York.","The White House hosted a ""Made in America Product Showcase"" Monday, and one of the attendees was Matt Roberts, president of the last US manufacturer of forks, spoons, and knives. That his Sherrill Manufacturing from upstate New York snagged an invite to the event wasn't a surprise—but Syracuse.com reports that Roberts soon spotted an anomaly in the State Dining Room. Everybody had just eaten with flatware made from China. The utensils were made by Oneida Ltd., which once manufactured its products in New York, but no more. In fact, Roberts' company now uses a former Oneida plant. ""With all of the things going on in the world, forks and spoons in your kitchen are not exactly the top priority at the White House,"" says Roberts. But the story suggests that might soon change. It notes how New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney has been pushing for the White House to make the switch, once even getting an assurance of it from President Trump himself (see the video). While Trump wasn't at Monday's event, two of his top economic advisers, Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, were in attendance, as was Tenney, who was making sure they knew the full story."

If the name Damien Hirst is on it, a minimum of £36,800, or about $58,000, appears to be the asking price. That’s how much the limited-edition skulls will be selling for in the gift shop of the artist’s latest exhibition at the Tate Modern in London. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Telegraph, the garishly colored skulls titled Hallucinatory Head are styled off of Hirst’s “spin” paintings, and are just one of many featured items inspired by the Englishman’s famous art pieces.

"By Andrew Kornblatt NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the ocean covers roughly 70 percent of our planet’s surface, we currently only have about 5-7 percent of that spectacularly large area mapped in any meaningful way. In fact, we have better maps of the surface of the moon and mars than we do of the ocean floor. XPRIZE, the non-profit foundation whose lofty mission is to “design and manage public competitions” that better mankind, has just launched a new ocean challenge which will likely draw the attention of marine scientists, geologists and hobbyists everywhere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The three-year global competition is focused on ocean mapping and, with a U.S.$ 7,000,000 prize purse and the illustrious title of “XPRIZE Winner”, the competition is is likely to push the technologies that drive ocean exploration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This competition is technically challenging, but it is also very interdisciplinary. It involves underwater robotics, it involves computer science, there is a digital imagery component to it… We expect a number of different approaches to this,” said Dr. Jyotika Virmani, XPRIZE Prize Lead and Senior Director. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Specifically, participants must complete a series of tasks through devices which must be launched from the shore or the air, and can operate at a depth of up to 4,000 meters. These tasks include making a high-resolution map of the sea-floor, taking high-definition images of specific objects, and identifying key features in a type of “treasure hunt.” There is also a “bonus” $1M challenge for technology that can monitor specific chemical and biological compounds in the water column; an attempt to “sniff out” a specified object in the ocean. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This latest XPRIZE is part of the foundation’s “Ocean Initiative.” The mapping challenge is the third in a series of five multi-million dollar prizes the foundation has promised to launch by 2020 to “address critical ocean challenges and inspire innovation that helps create an ocean that is healthy, valued and understood.” The past two ocean prizes have included Oil Spill Clean-Up and Ocean pH Sensor technologies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The announcement of the ocean mapping prize came during the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting in San Francisco and is a partnership between XPRIZE, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Shell Oil Company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Spurring innovation and creating radical breakthroughs in ocean discovery are what excite us about collaborating with XPRIZE,” said David Schewitz, Shell vice president of geophysics for the Americas. “Shell recognizes the need to leverage the full power of innovation: the capacity for doing things differently and better than before.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Collectively, Shell, NOAA and XPRIZE are all aligned in our goals, which is really the discovery of what is down there, what’s in the deep ocean,” explained Dr. Virmani. “We want to help spur unparalleled ocean exploration through innovation and radical breakthroughs to find all the different wonders in the deep sea.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The three-year competition includes nine months for team registration, which is now open for anyone, or any team who wants to register. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paul Bunje PhD, XPRIZE principal and senior scientist, described the contest’s openness in a interview with the Ocean Science Radio as, “anybody can compete from anywhere, we’re totally open.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McConnell on Monday said the party is looking to see if a write-in option could be successful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Documents filed to the Federal Elections Commission on Friday showed the National Republican Senatorial Committee -- one of the party's main campaign arms -- cut its fundraising ties with Moore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This story has been updated.","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is stepping up his official thoughts on Roy Moore. ""I think he should step aside,"" he said of the GOP Senate candidate during a presser Monday, the Hill reports. Asked more specifically about allegations that Moore, running in a special Dec. 12 election in Alabama, had a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old when he was 32 and that he attempted to romance three other teens around the same time, McConnell said, ""I believe the women."" The last time McConnell offered his thoughts on Moore, he qualified them by saying Moore should exit the race ""if these allegations are found to be true."" Many GOPers who initially qualified their remarks on Moore are also retreating since he told Sean Hannity last week he may have dated teen girls around that time. McConnell is the highest-ranking GOPer in DC to officially call on Moore to step down, per the Washington Post. McConnell also said the GOP is exploring a possible write-in bid, though he didn't name names. The deadline to remove Moore's name from the ballot passed in October. Republicans have also discussed the possibility of getting the election date moved back, and CNN reports the National Republican Senatorial Committee has cut its fundraising ties with Moore. But many Alabama Republicans are still backing him, concerned that a write-in campaign would ensure a Democratic win, and Moore himself shows no signs of willingness to back down. ""Apparently Mitch McConnell and the establishment GOP would rather elect a radical pro-abortion Democrat than a conservative Christian,"" read an email sent to his supporters Sunday night. He also tweeted Monday that ""the person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell. He has failed conservatives and must be replaced."" Recent polls show the margin between Moore and opponent Doug Jones is razor thin."

"MERIDEN, Conn. (WTNH) -- In the cold and the snow, it's easy to imagine what it was like 26 years ago today when a newborn boy was found dead in Meriden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The child was found on the ground near a tree, wrapped in a blanket on the morning of January 2, 1988,"" retired Detective Sergeant Keith McCurdy said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On a day colder than today, the baby soon froze to death. The local clergy named him David Paul, which means God's beloved little man. The police department took up a collection for his burial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The Meriden Police Department unofficially adopted this child and cared for this child's burial,"" McCurdy said, ""and we think David Paul represents all the children who are abused, neglected or abandoned."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David Paul was blond, blue-eyed, and full term. The former Chief says he would have gladly adopted him into his family. Police never found his mother, never identified him, and never charged anyone in his death. But every year since 1988, they've come here to pay their respects and remember. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It shows our commitment to the baby and to the children that we represent every day in the community,"" said Lt. Salvatore Nesci, Meriden Police Department, said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since then, the state has made it clear that new moms can go to any hospital and they will take care of the baby no questions asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for the idea that David Paul has come to represent all the kids police have sworn to protect, they say that is even more important this year, just a little over a year since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary.  Meriden police, church remember abandoned baby 26 years later NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Lauren Sievert Record-Journal staff NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MERIDEN — Members of the police department and a local church gathered in the freezing weather to remember the baby boy abandoned in a parking lot in 1988. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Retired Police Chief Robert E. Kosienski attended the memorial service at Walnut Grove Cemetery with about 20 members of the Meriden police department and the Rev. Alden Barnes, pastor of First United Methodist Church. Kosienski said he remembered the morning he got the call about the baby found abandoned in a South Meriden parking lot on Jan. 2, 1988. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was found frozen to death,” Kosienski said. “Why would a woman do that?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kosienski said his first reaction when he got the call was shock. He later found out the mother carried the baby to full term, and he had blonde hair and blue eyes. Kosienski said the massive effort to find the mother was not to punish her, but because the police believe there was “some kind of trauma” that led her to abandon the child. The baby was named David Paul, which means “God’s beloved little man” in scripture, and was officially adopted by the city police department. The child was buried in Walnut Grove Cemetery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barnes said this year at the memorial service he read a prayer for children, keeping in mind the recent one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy as well. “This death put a light on how vulnerable children are at all ages in this society,” Barnes said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barnes said a man attended the memorial service and said he was interested in the Safe Haven law that was passed in Connecticut in 2000. Mothers can voluntarily drop off infants under 30 days old at a hospital with no requirement to identify themselves. The infant will go into the custody of the Department of Children and Families.","It's a 26-year tradition now in Meriden, Conn., and one with a somber start: On Jan. 2, 1988, police found a newborn boy frozen to death outside. He had been wrapped in a blanket, but the full-term baby with blond hair and blue eyes stood no chance in the frigid weather. Police took up a collection and paid for his burial, reports WTNH, and members of the local clergy named him David Paul. Today, as they have on every Jan. 2 since then, police and others in the community gathered at the cemetery where the baby is buried. ""The Meriden Police Department unofficially adopted this child and cared for this child's burial,"" says a retired detective sergeant, ""and we think David Paul represents all the children who are abused, neglected, or abandoned."" The local Record-Journal notes that Connecticut has since passed a Safe Haven law that allows a mother to leave her baby at a hospital within 30 days of birth, no questions asked."
"KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) — Opening a three-day trip to the Caribbean and Central America, President Barack Obama hopes to capitalize on mutual needs in the face of expanding Chinese influence and weakening power by Venezuela, once the energy juggernaut of the Americas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. President Barack Obama, right, accompanied by Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N,Y, walks down the steps during their arrival on Air Force One, Wednesday, April 8, 2015 at Norman Manley International Airport... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. President Barack Obama waves during his arrival on Air Force One, Wednesday, April 8, 2015 at Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, Jamaica. Obama arrived to Jamaica for a two day visit... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama's arrival Wednesday evening in Kingston, Jamaica, was low-key compared to the excitement he stirred in the Caribbean upon his election in 2008. Greeted at the airport tarmac by dignitaries including Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller, Obama slipped into a motorcade that ran through mostly quiet, empty streets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The visit comes amid a perception that Obama's interest in the region has failed to materialize. Yet his travels — first to Jamaica, then to the Summit of the Americas in Panama — follow a year of increased attention to the region by the U.S. president. His immigration executive orders, his efforts to slow the influx of Central American minors to the U.S. border, and his diplomatic outreach to Cuba have put a foreign policy spotlight on U.S. neighbors to the south. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama on Thursday will meet with Simpson Miller and with other leaders in the 15-member Caribbean Community. He also plans to speak to young regional leaders in a town-hall setting, continuing a tradition of engaging new generations in foreign political and civil society institutions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president promptly paid tribute to the island's cultural hero, the late reggae star Bob Marley, making an unscheduled visit Wednesday night to the legendary singer's museum. He toured Marley's former home as Marley's hit ""One Love"" played through the building's sound system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Caribbean, energy security tops Obama's agenda as the U.S. seeks to fill a potential void left by Venezuela's scaled-back oil diplomacy. Earlier this year, Vice President Joe Biden hosted prime ministers and other top officials from all Caribbean countries except Cuba at the first Caribbean Energy Security Summit in Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We, in looking at the region, saw that a number of the (Caribbean) countries had significant energy needs,"" said Benjamin Rhodes, a White House deputy national security adviser. ""At the same time, the United States has significant resources, not just in terms of our own energy production, but also in our energy infrastructure, in our ability to work with countries that have formed cooperative solutions to promote energy security."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, China has steadily expanded its economic alliances in the Caribbean, providing much of the financing for new roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""China is running away with the gold in the view of many region watchers. Its footprint is visible and obvious through its 'checkbook' diplomacy in the Caribbean,"" said Anthony Bryan, an international relations professor at Trinidad's campus of the University of the West Indies. The public university system serves 18 English-speaking countries and territories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama's visit to Jamaica is the first by a U.S. president since President Ronald Reagan in 1982. Obama was last in the Caribbean region in 2009 when he attended the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To the strains of the late reggae star's One Love, Mr Obama was shown around the sprawling house in Kingston that was Mr Marley's final home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The US president said he was a fan of the musician, telling his museum guide: ""I still have all the albums."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But his first stop after landing in Kingston was the old Victorian-style house in central Kingston that Mr Marley called home between 1975 and his death in 1981. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Obama spent 20 minutes in the museum, which now houses artefacts from the singer's life including gold records and his Grammy Lifetime Achievement award. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His arrival aboard Air Force One on Wednesday made him the first sitting US president to set foot in the country since Ronald Reagan visited 33 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was greeted by Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and the US Ambassador to Jamaica, Luis Moreno. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Obama will meet representatives of the 15 countries in the Caribbean Community group on the three-day trip to Jamaica and Panama, and is expected to discuss energy and security issues.","President Obama arrived in Jamaica last night, and his first stop was the Bob Marley museum, the BBC reports. Obama is the first US president to visit Jamaica since Ronald Reagan did so in 1982, and he's apparently a big Marley fan: During his 20 minutes spent touring the Victorian-style house where the musician lived from 1975 to his death in 1981, he told the guide, ""I still have all the albums."" The stop was an unscheduled one, the AP reports. Of course, Obama is technically in Jamaica not as a tourist, but to discuss energy and security issues with representatives of the 15-country-strong Caribbean Community group. He'll spend three days in the Caribbean and Central America. The AP notes that while there was great excitement in the region when he was first elected, Obama's arrival was greeted with ""mostly quiet, empty streets,"" with locals having the feeling that the president's ""interest in the region has failed to materialize.""

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I saw it was burning in the grape bowl. How is that possible, I thought. Then I saw there was one intense point where (the sun) hit the twigs, and that's where it started,"" Richard Walter told Aftonbladet.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IKEA did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.  -The serving bowls in the BLANDA series are available in several different materials and sizes to mix and match according to your tastes and needs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR -Stack the smaller sizes inside the larger of the same range, to save space when not in use.  Richard Walter told the Aftonbladet tabloid he was eating grapes out of his Ikea 'Blanda blank' metal bowl in the sunshine during Sweden's weekend heatwave when he suddenly noticed a peculiar smell of smoke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He first thought it came from the neighbours' barbecue party, but then looked at the bowl. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I saw it was burning in the grape bowl. How is that possible, I thought. Then I saw there was one intense point where (the sun) hit the twigs, and that's where it started,"" Walter told the Aftonbladet tabloid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It appears the fire started when the bowl's shape caused the strong sunlight to reflect off its surface and concentrate the heat to one particular point. To prove to his friends that it really had happened, Walter then posted a video on Facebook using the bowl to burn a scrap piece of paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watch the video below: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ikea said it would look into the reports and carry out its own tests on the bowl.

In risk assessment for the bowl Blanda it has been established that many different parameters would have to converge for the content of the bowl to overheat and that the risk for this to happen is very low.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His name is Nolan Daniels, and he’s just about to give some random dude or dudette $1 million. Or so he claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Purporting to be the second Powerball winner in Wednesday’s $588 million payout, Mr. Daniels posted a Facebook photo late Thursday of himself holding a ticket showing the winning numbers. The photo is the only one visible on Daniels's account, which dates to 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Looks like I’m not going to work … EVER!!!” the smiling purported winner exclaimed. The numbers on his ticket – 5-23-16-22-29-Powerball 6 – correspond to the winning combination, but the ticket has not been publicly verified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To make the Facebook announcement that much more bizarre, Daniels vowed to give $1 million of his winnings to a “random” person who “shares” his photo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That set off a frenzy Friday as thousands of Facebook users got in on the action, with the photo being shared over 1,000 times a minute, with over 100,000 shares as of 3:30 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On his Facebook page, Daniels chastised skeptics and suggested, “Anyone who doubts the legitimacy of this photo will not be included in the 1 million dollar drawing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were two winners in the drawing.

Then he asked people to share the photo, promising $1 million to a random person who did so. As of this afternoon, more than 200,000 hopeful souls had done so. Alas, Adrien Chen at Gawker points out that if it were a real Powerball ticket, the numbers would be in numerical order, unlike the one in the ""poorly photoshopped"" image. It just goes to show that ""like-addled Facebook users will share anything no matter how obviously untrue it is,"" he writes. So far, then, we know only the identity of one of the two winners.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He had to be taken to the hospital with a crane by emergency and civil defense workers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors have not yet certified the cause of death. In addition to the cardiac condition, Uribe was also believed to have suffered from liver problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Uribe married Claudia Solis in 2008, and the wedding was one of the few times he left his home in recent years.

"Chelsea Handler on her new studio: 'I’m most excited about having a shower in my office' so I never have to walk semi-nude past my guests again Late-night talk and comedy host moves to new quarters that once served Jack Benny and Conan O'Brien NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What Chelsea Handler loves most about the new set for her late-night show is that she doesn’t have to parade partially nude past her guests anymore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m most excited about having a shower in my office, so that I no longer have to shower downstairs and then walk by the audience lineup in a robe,” says the “Chelsea Lately” host. “Yeah, I’m not joking, that’s what happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The audience would be lined up outside, and I would go downstairs to this industrial-like shower, put my hair up in a, like, a towel ponytail and a robe, and then walk out past them — while people would ask me to sign books. So we’re going to be avoiding that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The comedy talk show, which airs weeknights at 11 p.m. on E!, makes its big move Monday from a small studio in Santa Monica to the larger Stage 1 at Universal Studios. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stage 1 was built for “The Jack Benny Show” in 1962, and was also home to the doomed “Tonight Show With Conan O’Brien.” But Handler says she isn’t worried her show will meet the same fate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I'm not superstitious at all, I’m not a Russian,” cracks the comedian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Besides a private shower, the new studio has another advantage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have so much more space now that we’re going to be able to have Chuy enter on elephants and different kinds of animals,” Handler says of her oft-abused sidekick, Chuy Bravo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And what does Bravo think about the set upgrade? “Chuy can’t speak English, so I don’t even know if he knows about the move,” Handler quips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new set can accommodate 200 audience members, up from 75. But the show hopes to maintain an intimate vibe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Timothy White/E! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Conan has a great intimate audience and he is about 200,” Handler says. “My whole shtick is my audience, so I actually really want them more involved in the show, as cheesy as that may sound. We think of really funny ways to get them involved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Recently, for instance, we picked people out of the crowd and then just had them choose, out of three male [‘Chelsea Lately’] writers, whom they want to have sex with the least, and put them in order,” Handler explains. “I want my audience in there. I’m a standup comedian, so I need people.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Handler, 37, has hosted “Chelsea Lately” since 2007. It’s the most-watched cable late-night talk show among women age 18-34 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her close pal Jennifer Aniston appears on the show Monday, the first guest in the new digs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She’s a friend, and she’s a good friend, so she was nice enough to say yes,” Handler says. “And of course, she’s obviously the best person you can get. So she’s just an email away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re friends, so it’ll be a nice, relaxing conversation,” adds Handler. “My idea is I want all these great girls to be on the first couple of weeks to christen the stage and to kind of give me their blessing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other names this week include Fergie on Tuesday, Miley Cyrus on Wednesday and Christina Aguilera Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I like to have a home for people just to have a lot of fun,” Handler says of welcoming guests. “Everybody looks good on the show when they come on, and has a great sense of humor about themselves. I have no problem being the butt of the jokes, and everybody comes off looking hilariously funny.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new, state-of-the-art studio boasts improved sound and lighting systems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m here to stay, I’m not going anywhere,” Handler says. “I think for a while, I was kind of confused about what I was going to do, but now I’m not, so I’m going full throttle.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The movie star and talk show host appeared in the steamy skit together, which was shown in the US last night, to mark Chelsea's show's move to a new studio.","To mark her move to a new studio, Chelsea Handler last night … got naked in a shower with Sandra Bullock. Bullock took the opportunity to slap Handler around a bit, give her some career advice, and chide her for peeing in the shower. ""We don't make pee pee in showers anymore,"" Bullock informed her. ""We make pee pee in the potty."" But, the Sun reports, Handler later revealed that Bullock didn't go totally nude for the sketch, and only Handler was ""really naked."" Handler had earlier expressed her excitement that the new studio includes a shower in her office, the New York Daily News reports. ""I’m most excited about having a shower in my office, so that I no longer have to shower downstairs and then walk by the audience lineup in a robe,"" Handler said. ""Yeah, I’m not joking, that’s what happened."" Later on the last night's episode of Chelsea Lately, Jennifer Aniston appeared and actually teared up a bit while talking about her engagement to Justin Theroux, the Sun adds. ""I just got verklempt,"" Jen said. Handler is apparently a Theroux fan—she called him ""the greatest guy ever.""

"DUBAI Iran will increase its naval presence in the Gulf to strengthen its authority over three islands which the United Arab Emirates says are its territory, Tehran said on Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The islands sit near oil shipping routes at the mouth of the strategic Strait of Hormuz and the challenge over their sovereignty is a constant threat to Iran's fragile relations with its Arab neighbors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The security of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf is part of the various strategies of the naval force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,"" IRGC Commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to the website of state television IRIB. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jafari was speaking at a ceremony inaugurating a fifth ""naval defense zone"" at the port of Bandar Lengeh. He said the IRGC was ""increasing, expanding and improving the expert capability in naval defense"" in the five zones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The fifth zone of the Guards' naval force is one of the naval defense chains which is in particular responsible for the defense of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf,"" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 41-year-old dispute between Shi'ite Muslim Iran and the Sunni UAE over the islands - Greater and Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa - has nationalist and ethnic overtones and was inflamed when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Abu Musa in April. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In September, UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahayan said Iran's ""occupation"" of the three islands was against international law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said Tehran would consider downgrading ties with the UAE over the dispute, although the foreign ministry later denied the report, according to state television. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Reporting By Yeganeh Torbati and Zahra Hosseinian; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)  Iran's media is reporting the country has produced a domestically-made drone capable of hovering in midair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sunday report by several newspapers including the conservative Resalat says an advanced vertical take-off and landing or VTOL drone will be displayed in February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Resalat quoted Abbas Jam, who is director of the project, as saying that the drone can also fly in silence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier in October Iran said it obtained images of sensitive Israeli bases taken by a drone that was launched by Lebanon's Hezbollah movement that month and downed by Israel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iran says other drones made dozens of apparently undetected flights into Israeli airspace from Lebanon in recent years. Israel has rejected that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iran frequently claims breakthroughs in military technology and other achievements. Most are impossible to independently confirm.","Iran has been making increasing noises about its drone program, and Tehran's latest sabre-rattling says that it now has an advanced drone that can take off vertically, ie, without a runway. As Reuters reports by way of Iranian state media, a lead researcher claimed that the drone would be tested yesterday and ""unveiled"" next year, adding that the drone ""enjoys ultra-advanced technology and has been built for the first time in the world."" The drone is reportedly also capable of hovering in mid-air, and is silent, adds the AP. Iran earlier this week claimed it had drones far more advanced than Hezbollah's."

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR  The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday announced heightened security measures at federal buildings in the District and nationwide, citing the recent shooting at the Canadian Parliament and threats from terrorist groups to attack the homeland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DHS officials emphasized that the step was precautionary and not based on any intelligence about a specific terrorist plot. Rather, they said, the shootings in Canada and other events such as the ongoing U.S. bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria dictated that more security would be a wise measure. The increased security started over the weekend but was only announced Tuesday because of its sensitivity, they said.​ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a precautionary step to safeguard U.S. government personnel and facilities, and the visitors to those facilities,’’ said a senior DHS official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The changes are “not based on any specific, credible information at this time indicating any active plot against government officials and law enforcement in the United States.’’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced heightened security at federal buildings nationwide on Tuesday. (AP/Manuel Balce Ceneta) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In announcing the raised security alert, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said: “The reasons for this action are self-evident: the continued public calls by terrorist organizations for attacks on the homeland and elsewhere, including against law enforcement and other government officials, and the acts of violence targeted at government personnel and installations in Canada and elsewhere recently. ‘’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Given world events,’’ Johnson said, “prudence dictates a heightened vigilance in the protection of U.S. government installations and our personnel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson and other officials would not detail the new security measures or which government buildings will be affected, other than saying they will be buildings in D.C. and other major cities and locations around the country. “The precise actions we are taking and the precise locations at which we will enhance security is law-enforcement sensitive, will vary and shift from location to location, and will be continually re-evaluated,’’ Johnson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The DHS action, which will be carried out by the Federal Protective Service — which guards more than 9,500 federal facilities passed through by 1.4 million visitors or occupants daily — followed last week’s shocking violence in Canada. In Ottawa, the capital, a gunman killed an honor guard soldier and then opened fire inside the nearby Parliament building. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gunfire rocked the core of Canada’s government and set off a chaotic scene across downtown Ottawa, in a country that rarely sees gun violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Obama condemned the violence, saying “Obviously we’re all shaken by it.”","Security has been beefed up at federal buildings across the country—not because of any specific threat, but because of ""world events,"" the Department of Homeland Security says. The Federal Protective Service, which guards more than 9,500 federal courthouses and other buildings nationwide, boosted security measures over the weekend, days after a gunman made it into Canada's Parliament building, reports the Washington Post. ""The reasons for this action are self-evident: the continued public calls by terrorist organizations for attacks on the homeland and elsewhere, including against law enforcement and other government officials, and the acts of violence targeted at government personnel and installations in Canada and elsewhere recently,"" DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The error on Friday caused the social network to show a memorial banner on user profiles for people who were still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Users posted status updates to reassure friends and family they were not dead, despite Facebook's message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""This was a terrible error that we have now fixed,"" a Facebook spokesperson said. ""We are very sorry that this happened."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The message, intended for ""memorialised profiles"", erroneously appeared on the profile pages of a large number of users - including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life,"" the banner on his page read.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Facebook is capping one of the longest weeks in American history by telling everyone that they are dead,"" quipped The Verge, a technology website, in reference to the presidential election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The memorial feature was introduced by Facebook in 2015 because of a number of high-profile cases where family wanted to access the social accounts of deceased loved ones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR User can opt to have their account turn into a memorial page upon their death, where Facebook contacts can leave message and share memories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An alternative option is to have your account deleted after your death.  Facebook users were forced to do a double take on Friday as they leisurely scoped out their friends’ profiles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the top of the page, some people, including verified users, reported seeing memorial banners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The problem: the person memorialized wasn’t actually dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We hope people who love [Facebook user] will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate [his or her] life,” the banner read. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The switch to memorial pages left users shocked and confused.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m still alive at the moment!” another person exclaimed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg fell victim to the apparent bug.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If Facebook is made aware that a person has passed away, it’s our policy to memorialize the account,” Facebook explained in a post.","Killing off millions of users is as bad as a mistake as a website can make—but luckily for Facebook, it was reversible.

""We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life,"" said the message under the ""Remembering Mark Zuckerberg"" banner. Pages are usually only memorialized after a user dies and friends or family request the change and provide proof of death. Affected users scrambled to reassure friends and family that they were still alive, CBS reports. ""Having a tough day today, but not dead, just in case Facebook tries to claim that I am,"" one user posted. Facebook said it had introduced a new message for memorialized pages and accidentally displayed it on the accounts of around 2 million living users.

"Midday Sunday at Audubon Zoo, parked cars spilled from the asphalt parking lots into the surrounding grass. People slathered on sunscreen, pushed strollers and toted bathing suits. It was like any other weekend summer day at the zoo, except for dark reminders of the previous day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just over 24 hours prior, 3-year-old Valerio the jaguar escaped his enclosure and mauled nine animals. Six animals were dead by the time zoo staff regained control of the jaguar Saturday morning. Two more animals, an alpaca and a fox, eventually died from their injuries, leaving a single fox as the lone survivor of Valerio's hunt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite a concerted attempt to resume normal operation, the zoo could not shake the news of the attack. Throughout the zoo, parents could be heard lecturing children on the circle of life. Audubon staffers fielded questions about Valerio. And much of the Jaguar Jungle exhibit was empty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the entrance, Sean Brown asked the ticket seller if he'd get a chance to see a jaguar today. The seller responded with a polished announcement that the exhibit was closed for the time being as the staff grappled with yesterday's incident. Brown is from Jamaica and, despite being in his 30s, this was his first time at a zoo. He had bought a ticket for yesterday, but the zoo closed the facility following the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I suppose this doesn't happen often, but he's just an animal,"" Brown said, his eyes surveying a map of the sprawling zoo. ""He didn't know they were his colleagues."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many, including Audubon staffers, shared Brown's sentiments about Valerio's lethal attack, which left five alpacas, two foxes and one emu dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a news conference Saturday (July 14), Joe Hamilton, vice president and general curator at the zoo, called Valerio ""a normal jaguar"" just ""doing what jaguars do."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, there was no shaking the reality of previously filled enclosures missing some or all of their typical inhabitants. The alpaca paddock, positioned only yards from the jaguar exhibit, was empty. A sign identifying the species had been removed. The zoo acquired the alpacas in March from farms in Mobile, Alabama, and south Mississippi. All five of them were killed during Valerio's escape. A white sign was zip-tied to the jaguar enclosure, explaining that the exhibit was ""under repair"" due to ""the recent incident."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jessica Netterville and Jessica Danby are friends and Audubon Society members, who often make the trek across Lake Ponchartrtain to bring their young boys to the zoo. They booked their Sunday trip long before news of the escape broke, but the recent event put their longstanding weekend tradition into question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It definitely opened up the question of whether or not we should even have zoos and if we feed the zoo industry by bringing our kids here,"" said Danby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two mothers also expressed concern about zoo employees who worked with the killed animals or had to clean up the aftermath of the attack. These workers signed up to be caretakers and their day included so much gore, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Audubon officials announced that the zoo would bring in grief counselors to meet with impacted staffers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sunday afternoon crowds continued to roll in despite the day's sweltering temperatures and high humidity. Just outside the ticket booths, a crowd of children and parents gathered near the gift shop. Two kids knelt over a stuffed alpaca toy and a handwritten letter left by a young girl named Lily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter read: ""To all the animals killed or injured in the jaguar accident, especially the guanacos (""alpacas""): Your hearts will always be in our memories, even if not many people noticed you over the capyberas and gators and turtles.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sears said this in a statement: ""The item, which was listed by an independent third-party on Sears Marketplace, violates our guidelines and was immediately removed.""  Walmart, Amazon and Sears came under social media fire from shoppers over the holiday weekend for selling a commemorative poster featuring a photo of one of Nazi Germany’s concentration camps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Online shoppers were horrified to learn that an image from Dachau’s main gate was being sold as a piece of home decor. The offending item was listed on the Walmart page with the description: “Gate with inscription Arbeit Macht Frei, Dachau Concentration Camp, Dachau.” Walmart also promised that the poster “would make a great addition to your home or office.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The slogan “Arbeit macht frei” is a sinister German expression favored by Nazis that translates to “work makes you free.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The image shocked many and galvanized members of the Facebook group Grandchildren of Holocaust Survivors to complain.

"By David Nelson CFA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sentiment coming into 2017 was mixed, mostly divided around political affiliation. Those in support of change pointed to aggressive growth expectations on the heels of tax reform and deregulation. On the other side, economists like Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman believed expecting anything approaching 3-3.5% GDP was little more than economic arrogance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investors have cast their votes driving up U.S. stocks more than 20% in 2017. Today, as we approach the end of the year it’s natural for those same investors to turn their attention to 2018 and beyond. It’s a ritual as old as markets but fraught with risk. After a 20% rise in stocks Wall Street has become unquestionably bullish with Oppenheimer’s John Stolzfus already announcing an S&P 500 target of 3000 for next year. Even Goldman which spent much of the year focused on the downside is looking for a modest rise on the heels of tax reform. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One thing about crystal balls. When you look at the beginning of the year they seem decidedly clear with all but a GPS moving map showing us the path down the Yellow Brick Road. Unfortunately, just when you need it most it starts to malfunction failing to alert you when the Wicked Witch of the East zooms in for the kill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The danger in these predictions is that more often than not we extrapolate recent history into the future. If the market was up in the last year, than by all means it should continue. If we’ve been in a prolonged downturn than of course expect markets to continue to struggle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most dangerous predictions of all are those that go out 3-4 even 5 years. Anyone making long term predictions about how something as complex as the world economy is going to react 5 years from now, is likely on par with my prediction the New York Jets will re-sign Joe Namath and win the Super Bowl in 2020. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The above doesn’t make predictions a useless exercise. It’s ok to plan ahead but explore both sides of the issue knowing that your opponent’s crystal ball may be more accurate than your own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I currently fall into that same camp as many extrapolating 2017 a very good year into the next. PMI data around the world points to geosynchronous growth which doesn’t happen all that often. Strength in overseas markets means our customers are doing well and that’s great news for U.S. multinationals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Markets are driven by all sorts of factors but in the long run they follow earnings. There are any number of items in this tax bill I don’t agree with but if the corporate rate comes in anywhere close to 20%, then 15% earnings growth is doable. $150 in S&P earnings isn’t out of the question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Add the fact that these very same large caps will get access to a couple trillion dollars parked off shore and the picture looks pretty bright. The question is; what will they do with it? I’ve been critical of CEOs for focusing too much attention on buybacks. I believe, we’re at the beginning of a capex cycle as CEOs understand that they have to start growing the top line if they want to remain competitive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Buybacks are slowing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Buybacks have already started slowing, peaking in early 2016. You’ve heard me say this in any number of interviews; “the next leg of the bull market isn’t going to come on the heels of financial engineering.” There are too many examples of buyback casualties that bought back their own stock at higher prices effectively destroying capital.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tax Reform Passes…but GDP Can’t Reach 3% NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Trump and the GOP-led Congress are able to enact some corporate tax reforms, but learn that tax cuts alone can’t quickly compensate for an aging population and an under-skilled middle class. GDP grows by 2.5% for the year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Federal Funds Rate lands at 2.25% the end of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yuge economic growth remains elusive, but continued low unemployment puts enough upward pressure on wages and prices to prompt more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and new chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed’s benchmark tops rate 2% for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oil Will Cost $55 a Barrel Next Christmas NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Politics and the occasional disruptive summer storm will make the price of crude fluctuate plenty in 2018.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Home Prices (Barely) Rise NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zillow asked more than 100 economists and real estate experts where they thought home prices would wind up next year. The average answer? Up by 4.1%—significantly slower than the current rate of about 6.9% growth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. IPO market jumps to life again NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year was particularly weak for domestic IPO proceeds, at just $16.2 billion. That ticked up to a projected $39.7 billion this year, and—according to global law firm Baker McKenzie— will hit $70.9 billion in 2018.

On Aug. 7, Ethan was with his mom, Tracy Dowdy Fain, at the hospital getting stitches from a reconstructive surgery removed, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Suddenly, Fain, who had complained of a headache, collapsed. Doctors found Fain suffered a brain aneurysm and stroke. Her daughter, Jessica Dowdy, says she wouldn't have survived if she wasn't already in a hospital when it happened. In the coming days, the swelling in Fain's brain got worse, and she was declared brain dead Tuesday. “Her body is still here, but her soul is gone,” Dowdy says. The family still hasn't told Ethan. “All he knows is mommy is sick and the doctors are trying to make her better like they made him better,” Dowdy says. A GoFundMe account has been set up for Fain, who also lost a nephew last month."

The names of the jurors who determined Casey Anthony 's fate when they found her not guilty of first-degree murder this past summer were revealed this morning.But even with their identities revealed, there may remain one big, lingering question: Why did they reach the verdict that they did?None of the jurors — all Pinellas County residents — is obligated to talk to the media about the six weeks they spent serving on Anthony's trial in Orlando.The jurors are Joan Meier, Raymond Screen, Linda Bills, Harriet White, Brian Berling, Kimberly Kimball, Kathleen Nighland, James Kearns, Ronald Robertson, David Angelo, Mary Fuhr and Jennifer Ford.Alternate jurors whose names were not previously released are Elizabeth Jones and Heather Feuerhake.Alternate jurors Dean Edward Eckstadt and Russell William Huekler already voluntarily revealed their identities publicly.The panel already turned down one opportunity to speak to the media collectively.Sentinel reporters and a photographer have been knocking on doors throughout Pinellas County today, searching for the jurors. Many knocks went unanswered, and some neighbors said their juror neighbors had left town.Although the trial ended in July, the names were not released until today.In Anthony's high-profile case, Orange-Osceola Chief Judge Belvin Perry postponed the release of the juror names for three months as a ""cooling off"" period.In his July 26 order, Perry expressed significant concern over the safety of the jurors, noting that they ""returned a verdict which was not viewed in a popular light by a large segment of the public.""Perry recalled how the crowd outside the Orange County Courthouse reacted to the July verdict, holding signs that said, ""Arrest the Jury,"" and ""Somewhere a Village is Missing 12 Idiots."" He also cited a news report saying one juror had to quit work and leave the state due to threats.""Only time will heal those upset by the verdict and will allow public interest to subside sufficiently that violence may be avoided,"" Perry wrote in postponing the release of juror names until today.Anthony, 25, was found not guilty in July of killing her 2-year-old daughter Caylee Marie in the summer of 2008.The 12-member jury also found Anthony not guilty of aggravated child abuse and not guilty of aggravated manslaughter of a child. The jury did find her guilty of the far less significant charges of lying to law enforcement.It was a verdict that stunned spectators and angered the public.The jury was given the opportunity to talk to the media about their decision almost immediately after they rendered a verdict, but the panel declined.Perry noted in his order that he met with the jurors after the verdict and most ""were adamant about their desire not to contact the media or appear on TV shows even though they could have received handsome payment for their time and effort.""","The jurors who cleared Casey Anthony of murder now might have to explain the verdict to their neighbors. Florida today released the jurors' identities, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Normally, the names are made public immediately after a trial, but the judge ordered a three-month delay given the public outrage over the verdict.

I'll address my future in the campaign there. #chafee2016 — Lincoln Chafee (@LincolnChafee) October 23, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Chafee is a former governor and senator from Rhode Island and his poll numbers have been hovering around zero and he has only raised about $30,000 in his campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He did not help his cause at last week’s Democratic presidential debate, when he stumbled on questions about his record or and in trying to make a case for his candidacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the debate, the CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer asked him if he was worried that his campaign was making him look silly and questioned how long he could go on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An anti-war candidate who is passionate about foreign policy and opposed the Iraq war, Mr. Chafee said he remained intent on getting his message out despite the long odds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This week Jim Webb, another Democrat who had been struggling to break through, dropped out of the race and is considering an independent bid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokeswoman for Mr. Chafee did not immediately return a request for comment on Thursday evening about Mr. Chafee’s plans.  (CNN) Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee ended his long-shot bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, he announced Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""As you know, I have been campaigning on a platform of Prosperity Through Peace,"" Chafee said at the DNC's annual Women's Leadership Forum in Washington.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Democrat declared his presidential campaign in June, shortly after announcing that he had formed an exploratory committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the reasons Chafee decided to drop out now: Hillary Clinton had ""a good week,"" he said, one where former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb dropped out of the race, Vice President Joe Biden declined to run and she withstood hours of testimony on Capitol Hill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Obviously it was a good week for Secretary Clinton,"" Chafee told reporters after his speech.

Two big reasons he dropped out: He was somewhere between 0% and 1% in the polls, and he'd raised only $30,000, reports the New York Times.

"The conservative blogger who reported that a photo of a man's crotch had been sent from Rep.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservative activist Andrew Breitbart of the website BigGovernment.com tells NBC's ""Today"" show he considers the image ""an insurance policy"" against attacks from Weiner, who on Monday admitted the crotch photo was of him. The married Weiner also acknowledged he had engaged in inappropriate contact with six women over three years through social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook and occasionally over the phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breitbart told NBC Tuesday that if Weiner wants to open himself to further investigation, ""there are a lot of women"" who could come forward.

"This morning during the NFL’s first game of the day, a bunch of players on both sidelines knelt during the national anthem while other players and Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan stood arm-in-arm.

He then highlighted why Trump will lose on this issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We salute the flag, because the struggles and the sacrifices of generations of Americans to make this a better country. That is why we stand and salute our flag and why we put our hand over our heart. He could have come away the winner.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s new ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, warned German companies to halt activities in Iran after the U.S. leader said Washington was pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and would reimpose sanctions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Grenell, a long-time critic of the 2015 nuclear deal, posted the warning on Twitter just hours after arriving in Berlin and presenting his credentials to the German president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump made the announcement in a televised address from the White House, in a move that will raise the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upset Germany and America’s other European allies, and unsettle global oil markets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran’s economy,” Grenell said in his first posting on Twitter after arriving in Germany. “German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German industry reacted nervously to the U.S. announcement, warning that European companies could face U.S. fines if their Iranian business partners wound up on U.S. sanctions lists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Grenell is starting his job in Berlin nearly 16 months after his predecessor John Emerson left the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Republican foreign policy writer and avid Twitter user, Grenell was an aide to Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, when Bolton was former Republican President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations. Grenell served as the U.S. spokesman at the United Nations from 2001 to 2008, and then worked as a contributor to Fox News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Senate confirmed Grenell on April 26, making him the highest-ranking openly gay official in the Trump administration. The next day, he joined Trump at the White House to welcome Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks that produced little movement on trade disputes or the Iran accord. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump had nominated Grenell in September but key Democrats help up his confirmation, citing concerns about what they called Grenell’s history of making statements insulting to women politicians on the internet and during television appearances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about such comments during his confirmation hearing, Grenell said he was trying to be funny, not insulting, and would not have made such statements while serving as a U.S. public official.

It's all due to this tweet, made shortly after Trump spoke: ""As @realDonaldTrump said, US sanctions will target critical sectors of Iran’s economy. German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately."" Reuters notes Grenell has himself long-opposed the nuclear deal. That sentiment aligns with the White House's—indeed, Grenell, a former Fox News contributor who Page Six notes had an ""A-list"" going away bash, subsequently tweeted that he directly lifted the language from documentation provided to him by the administration. But the Washington Post observes that ""the timing and tone struck some German politicians, journalists and businessmen as offensive and inappropriate."" It characterizes the tweet as coming off as a threat and rounds up plenty of reaction, including this from the leader of the country's Social Democratic party: ""It’s not my task to teach people about the fine art of diplomacy, especially not the US ambassador. But he does appear to need some tutoring."" Grenell, the administration's top-ranking openly gay official, fills an ambassadorship that has been empty for 16 months."

"Posted: 09:30 PM ET NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From CNN’s Abby Livingston and Joe Von Kanel NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington (CNN) - Joe Miller is giving up, but he isn’t standing down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also needs Senator Lisa Murkowski’s phone number. Miller won Alaska’s Republican U.S. Senate primary, lost the general election to a write-in campaign waged by incumbent Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, then unsuccessfully challenged the results in court. Today in Anchorage, he told supporters the time has come, "" to accept the practical realities of our current legal circumstances. We shall abide by the court's decisions even if we do not agree with them."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also sounded a defiant note, adding: “I know for a fact that standing down is not an option, and I will continue to sound the alarm about our state and the nation.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eleven minutes after his news conference, Senator Murkowski’s campaign issued the following statement, “I was glad to learn that Joe Miller has bowed to the rulings of the Alaska courts and decided to abandon his challenges. Although certification was a long time coming, it does not diminish the historic accomplishment of our campaign. All Alaskans, regardless of how they voted, can be assured that I will continue to work in Alaska’s interest for the next six years.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his first interview after his public concession, Miller appeared on “John King, USA,” where CNN’s Ed Henry asked him if he had called Murkowski to personally concede. Miller said, “I have not called her. In fact, I don't have her number.” When asked if he had sought out her phone number through the Alaska GOP, he answered, ""Well, I think we already have conceded. We've asked for it before. I don't have it."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the brutal campaign, Miller also addressed any unresolved issues with the Murkowski camp, “Well, I'm not going to talk about sour grapes. There are a lot of things during the campaign that obviously I think should have been done differently, but frankly, what this is about is two completely different ideologies.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added, “We have no ill will toward Senator Murkowski. We have absolutely nothing to dispute as far as the finality of this race right now, but we have significant differences of opinion about where this nation needs to head.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Miller was also asked if there was anything to be read into his highest profile backer, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, taking a lower profile in the campaign while the courts sorted out a resolution. Miller said, “Not at all. In fact, the argument that was had during the … post-race, is a legal argument. It's not one where campaigning is appropriate. It's not one where somebody gets out and starts making stump speeches for a candidate. Certainly, SARAHPAC donated to our recount fund. We're very gracious to have received that. A number of other groups, a number of other people also donated. Senator Demint was key to assisting in that effort as well, and they certainly continue to stand behind us.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Filed under: JKUSA  Joe Miller finally conceded the Alaska Senate race to Sen.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a news conference Friday, Miller told a group of supporters he would not appeal Murkowski's 10,000-vote write-in victory, effectively ending two months of legal battles in which the GOP nominee challenged the legitimacy of the incumbent's win. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday Murkowski was officially certified the winner, allowing her to be sworn in on Jan. 5 along with the full slate of newly elected senators.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Miller had sued the state over what he considered its improper attempts to determine voters's intent, arguing statute required voters to spell Murkowski's name correctly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A federal judge ruled against Miller saying that voter intent was paramount and that Miller's interpretation ""would erode the integrity of the election system."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While he declined to attempt an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Miller defended his legal actions Friday saying his challenge will lead to ""more transparent, clearer standards"" in Alaska.

Murkowski had been officially certified as winner the day before. Miller said he hadn't conceded to her personally. “I have not called her. In fact, I don't have her number,"" he told CNN.

(Reuters) - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh said on Wednesday it had removed Cardinal Donald Wuerl’s name from a high school after a grand jury report on sex abuse in the Church found he had reassigned priests who had been accused of abusing children, rather than taking stronger action. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FILE PHOTO: Cardinal Donald William Wuerl attends before Pope Francis leads a consistory at the Vatican, February 12, 2015. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prior to his current role as archbishop of Washington, Wuerl was bishop of Pittsburgh from 1988 to 2006. The grand jury report did not accuse him of personally sexually abusing children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pittsburgh diocese said in a statement that following the release of the report, Wuerl asked last week for his name to be removed from Cardinal Wuerl North Catholic High School, saying he did not want to be a distraction. The school has been renamed North Catholic High School. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A two-year investigation into abuse in Pennsylvania found evidence that at least 1,000 people, mostly children, had been sexually abused by some 300 clergymen during the past 70 years. The report said the numbers of actual victims and abusers could be much higher. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report found that Wuerl notified the Vatican in 1989 of several priests who had been accused of sexually abusing children but that over subsequent years he granted requests by some to be reassigned to other parishes or to retire early, and in one case approved a loan to assist one such priest with personal debts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, Wuerl canceled a planned speech at this week’s World Meeting of Families in Dublin, the second high-ranking U.S. Church official to do so.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a letter to priests in the diocese, Wuerl said he will meet with Francis about the resignation he presented nearly three years ago at age 75, the mandatory age for Catholic bishops to submit their retirement to the Pope. He said a decision about his future ""is an essential aspect so that this archdiocesan church we all love can move forward.""

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ed McFadden, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Washington, said on Wednesday that Wuerl will ask Pope Francis to accept his resignation. McFadden said he did not know when the meeting would occur. A contingent of American bishops is meeting on Thursday with the Pope in Rome, but Wuerl is not among them, according to the Vatican. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a recent meeting with the Pope in Vatican City, Wuerl said in his letter, the Pope asked him to consider the best course of action ""as we face new revelations of the extent of the horror of the clergy abuse of children and the failures in episcopal oversight."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read More  Facing an uproar over revelations that he mismanaged past cases of clerical sexual abuse, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Washington, sent a letter informing his priests on Tuesday that he plans to discuss his resignation with Pope Francis in Rome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cardinal Wuerl has faced calls for his resignation by some of his priests and parishioners since the release of a bombshell grand jury report last month in Pennsylvania. Cardinal Wuerl previously served as the archbishop of Pittsburgh, and the report included accounts of his allowing several priests accused of sexually abusing children to remain in ministry, after relying on the advice of psychologists who had assessed the priests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cardinal had gained the confidence of both Francis and his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who relied on the low-key bureaucrat to steer international gatherings of bishops at the Vatican. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Cardinal Wuerl has been tarred by association with his predecessor in Washington, the former Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, who recently stepped down as a cardinal after accusations that decades ago, he molested an altar boy and coerced seminary students to sleep in his bed.","Since last month's grand jury report describing how the former archbishop of Pittsburgh reassigned priests accused of abusing children, Cardinal Donald Wuerl has had his name scrubbed from a school, been the subject of protests by Catholic schoolteachers, and faced calls from priests and parishioners to resign. Resignation is now on the table, the 77-year-old archbishop of Washington wrote in a Tuesday letter to priests, laying out a plan to discuss the subject with Pope Francis in Rome. Wuerl submitted his resignation at age 75 as is required of Catholic bishops, but the pope kept him on as one of his top US advisers, per the New York Times and CNN. During a meeting two weeks ago, the pope told Wuerl to consult with priests about the best way forward, reports the Wall Street Journal. Amid questions over whether he knew about molestation claims against his predecessor, former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, he heard calls for him both to stay and resign. That showed the need for ""some decision, sooner rather than later, on my part,"" Wuerl writes. Noting abuse survivors ""have personally suffered so much,"" his letter adds non-victims ""have also been wounded by the shame of these terrible actions and have questions about their bishop's ability to provide the necessary leadership."" The letter doesn't say whether Wuerl will ask the pope to accept his resignation, however. (Carlo Maria Vigano, the Vatican's former ambassador to the US, said Wuerl was complicit in a coverup.)"

"The 40 piece Chicken McNugget is the most substantial meal available at McDonald’s, according to calorie counts published by the fast food chain. At 1,880 calories, enough energy is packed into 40 chicken nuggets to provide lunch for a family or group of friends, and close to the daily average recommended caloric intake for an individual. The Big Breakfast with Hotcakes and a large biscuit is second on the menu, with 1,310 calories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 24/7 Wall St. reviewed roughly 500 McDonald’s menu items, including burgers, sandwiches, salads, beverages, and sides, to determine the most calorie heavy options available at the fast food giant. Most of the highest calorie foods from McDonald’s are larger sandwiches such as the chicken club or large portion items such as the 40 piece Chicken McNugget. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The size of the item is not the only factor in its calorie count. The 16 ounce McFlurry with M&M’s contains 930 calories, and the Large Oreo Frappe contains 810. While each of these drinks is equal to roughly half the recommended daily intake of 2,000 to 2,800 calories, as beverages they might be only part of a much larger meal. One chicken sandwich, medium french fries, and a McFlurry — an entirely plausible lunch order at McDonald’s and likely one of three meals in a day — has well over 2,000 calories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Click here to see the 50 McDonald’s menu items with the most calories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McDonald’s meals have more calories than home-cooked meals and also food served at most non-fast food chains. But while the obesity epidemic in the United States is widely linked to high calorie consumption, no studies demonstrate a direct link between McDonald’s specifically and adverse health outcomes. Academic research does, however, show high concentrations of obesity and other negative health outcomes in areas where there are high concentrations of fast food restaurants of any type. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Calories represent the amount of energy a body can generate from a given portion of food. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are all processed by the body to generate energy, or calories. Therefore, since energy can come from different food sources with varying nutritional benefits, calories alone do not tell the full story. An item with relatively few calories, for example, may have more sodium than a higher-calorie alternative. With 630 calories, the Premium Grilled Chicken Bacon Clubhouse Sandwich provides what would constitute an ordinary meal in calorie count. With 1,740 milligrams of sodium, however, the sandwich has nearly the most sodium on the menu. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To identify the 50 McDonald’s menu items with the most calories, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed nutritional information for 500 menu items as listed on McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) website. For similarly branded items of equal caloric value — the Quarter Pounder with Cheese and the Quarter Pounder Deluxe, for example — only one item was considered. Fat and carbohydrates measured in grams and sodium measured in milligrams also came from McDonald’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These are the 50 most substantial McDonald’s menu items.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Halloween costume, which referred to both the dystopian Margaret Atwood novel and Hulu series, was depicted as a bright red mini dress and cape with high heels. BuzzFeed News reported on the costume earlier Thursday, chronicling the Twitter responses that ranged from confusion to disgust. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s part of the statement from Yandy: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the last few hours, it has become obvious that our “Yandy Brave Red Maiden Costume” is being seen as a symbol of women’s oppression, rather than an expression of women’s empowerment. This is unfortunate, as it was not our intention on any level. Our initial inspiration to create the piece was through witnessing its use in recent months as a powerful protest image. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The red cloaks and white bonnets worn by handmaids (aka the fertile women in the fictional Gilead who are subjected to ritualized rape and forced pregnancy) in The Handmaid’s Tale have been adopted as symbols of feminism. Most recently, women wore outfits inspired by the narrative to protest the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the “brave red maiden costume” was much more revealing. Here was Yandy’s original description of the costume: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An upsetting dystopian future has emerged where women no longer have a say. However, we say be bold and speak your mind in this exclusive Brave Red Maiden costume. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some people on Twitter thought the execution of the costume was confusing, while many others found it completely appalling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wait.

Yandy’s statement said: “Given the sincere, heartfelt response, supported by numerous personal stories we’ve received, we are removing the costume from our site.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Luckily, there are still plenty of other sexy costumes to choose from. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR H/T Jezebel","Halloween costumes based on popular TV shows usually do well their first year out, but one new getup was nixed before the first pumpkin was carved. The Daily Dot reports Yandy.com, a retail site known for its sexy costumes, yanked one based on the Hulu series The Handmaid's Tale after ""confusion and disgust"" was the main reaction to it online. The costume, labeled ""Yandy Brave Red Maiden Costume"" and listing for $64.95, consisted of a short red dress, matching red cape, and white bonnet. The sultry-looking blonde model sporting the costume wore black high heels. The accompanying description: ""An upsetting dystopian future has emerged where women no longer have a say. However, we say be bold and speak your mind in this exclusive Brave Red Maiden costume."" This all prompted an outcry on Twitter, namely because the concept behind the Hulu show, based on the Margaret Atwood novel, revolves around handmaidens who are raped and forced to carry pregnancies to term for elite families. Others tried to make light of it, noting that knockoffs of the handmaiden costumes are often worn at protests advocating for women's rights. And that seems to have been Yandy's original intent, at least according to a statement it put out after the pushback started. ""It has become obvious that our … [costume] is being seen as a symbol of women's oppression, rather than an expression of women's empowerment,"" it said, adding that the costume has been pulled."

"SAN FRANCISCO—California secession dreamers can begin collecting signatures to place a nationhood proposal on the November 2018 ballot, after language for the measure was approved this week by the state’s attorney general. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The notion of a “Calexit”—a highly improbable idea that would require an amendment to the U.S. Constitution—gained popularity on social media following President Donald Trump’s unexpected victory in November,...  Photo: YesCalifornia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like the talk of secession in conservative southern states after Barack Obama became president, the idea of a separate California Republic builds on long-standing separatist feelings amplified by a momentous national election. Since Donald Trump became president while securing less than a third of the vote in California, the Yes California campaign — a.k.a. Calexit — has gotten a lot of attention and perhaps even some momentum in getting an initial measure placed on the 2018 general election ballot. An estimated 7,000 volunteers have begun amassing the 585,407 signatures necessary to place a constitutional amendment on the 2018 ballot deleting the state’s adherence to the United States and authorizing a 2019 referendum on independence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The arguments for Calexit are pretty simple: The state is drifting ever-further away from the rest of the country in cultural attitudes and public policies, especially with respect to immigration and the environment. California’s size and wealth (its GDP is similar to that of France) make it the one state that might make a go of it alone. It is also a “donor state” when it comes to the relationship of federal taxes collected from Californians to the federal spending conducted there; one recent analysis showed California ranking 46th among the states in relative dependence on Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it’s clear the main reason for sudden interest in Calexit is Donald J. Trump, and the possibility a federal Republican regime under his direction would preempt California preferences on a wide range of issues. Even though Governor Jerry Brown and other statewide Democratic elected officials have kept their distance from Calexit, the saber-rattling they have conducted about the state’s willingness to fight Trump and the GOP in court has undoubtedly fed the Calexit sentiment. The latest Trump provocation, threatening sanctuary cities with the cancellation of all federal funds, is being perceived by both his friends and enemies as mainly aimed at the Golden State. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By some definitions, the entire state of California is a sanctuary state. A law passed in 2014 prohibits local jails from holding immigrants any longer than required by criminal law, with exceptions for violent and other serious crimes. And most counties in the state also prohibit holding immigrants beyond their sentence if federal immigration agents do not have a judicial order. And legislation currently making its way through the Legislature would further expand the law, by prohibiting all state and local law enforcement agencies to respond to requests from immigration authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Having said all that, the process required to make Calexit a reality is not just daunting: It’s basically impossible. The first part is the easiest: If Yes California can get its initiative onto the 2018 ballot, it needs only 50-percent-plus-one approval to amend the state constitution. But then the 2019 referendum it authorizes is on shaky legal ground, and according to Yes California’s own ground rules, it would only “pass” if 50 percent of registered voters participated and 55 percent voted for independence. The participation standard alone sets a pretty high bar for success in an off-year election; turnout in the last regular midterm election was only 42 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If a Calexit referendum in California succeeded, of course, it would only take effect if the rest of the country went along with it. That would mean a constitutional amendment requiring two-thirds votes in Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states, or the first constitutional convention since 1787. The only alternative, unilateral secession, was tried in 1861, as close scholars of history could tell you, and it did not work out well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What the whole Calexit movement really represents is a cry of defiance against Trump, and against the temporary national triumph of people who are fine with melting down the polar ice caps to build more strip malls, instituting racial profiling as a cherished national law-enforcement policy, and criminalizing abortion. Any number of developments could take the steam out of Calexit, including the collapse of the Republican Party amid internecine quarreling. In any case, it ain’t happening — but it’s still a convenient lightning rod for real West Coast fury. And interest in the idea will get a boost from contemptuous conservatives who have long regarded the state as a nature preserve for hippies, sodomites, and border-crashers. There’s nothing like the prospect of secession to dramatize Americans’ very real differences.  A group trying to get California to secede from the United States said the results of the presidential election give their cause new momentum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supporters of the campaign for California to secede from the United States can now begin collecting the hundreds of thousands of signatures they need to get a proposed ""Calexit"" initiative on the ballot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the measure gets on the ballot and gains approval by a majority of voters, it would repeal clauses in the California Constitution stating that the state is an ""inseparable part of the United States"" and that the U.S. Constitution is the ""supreme law of the land,"" according to the title and summary prepared by the state attorney general's office.","The far-fetched idea of California seceding from the nation took a tiny step forward this week. California's secretary of state agreed to allow a group called Yes California to begin collecting signatures for a ballot measure, reports the Los Angeles Times. If 585,407 are collected by July 25—a high hurdle for the relatively small group—a proposal will land on the 2018 ballot to erase lines in the state Constitution outlining California as ""an inseparable part of the United States"" and the US Constitution as the ""supreme law of the land."" If passed, it would set up a 2019 vote on whether California should become ""a free, sovereign and independent country."" Even if that passed, huge hurdles remain. Secession would require a constitutional amendment, with two-thirds support in both the US House and Senate and ratification by at least 38 states. ""It's basically impossible,"" notes a post at New York. The idea of a ""Calexit"" has been in the works since 2014, but the Wall Street Journal notes that it got a boost after Donald Trump's election as a mostly jokey way to register opposition. Seems nuts? ""I think we'd have the votes today,"" says a group co-founder, who argues that California gives the federal government more money than it receives and is ""culturally"" separate from the rest of the country. ""America already hates California, and America votes on emotions."" Adds a rep for the California National Party, which supports secession in the long-term but not the current effort, ""It's certainly as likely as Donald Trump becoming president."" (The movement already has a Moscow ""embassy"".)"

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — A faith ministry in Nebraska has started a fundraising campaign to buy out four stores that sell millions of cans of beer each year in a tiny village next to a South Dakota Indian reservation plagued by alcoholism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Lakota Hope street ministry in Whiteclay is looking to raise at least $6.3 million to close the stores, which are only about 200 yards from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The officially dry reservation is plagued by high rates of fetal alcohol syndrome and encompasses some of the nation's poorest counties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whiteclay only has about a dozen residents, yet the four stores sold 3.5 million cans of beer in 2015. The beer stores have remained opened for decades despite state investigations into alleged liquor law violations, lawsuits and protests that occasionally turned violent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ministry founder Bruce BonFleur and his wife have lived in Whiteclay for nearly two decades, feeding people on the streets and launching programs designed to help members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. BonFleur said he has talked with the businesses, and ""we believe that the beer store owners are ready to sell out."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stores have been facing increasing legal and political pressure, and state liquor regulators are meeting next month to discuss the stores' licenses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, some activists have their doubts. Olowan Martinez, an Oglala Lakota activist who has led protests against Whiteclay, said she would be thrilled but shocked if the buyout worked as intended. Martinez said she would support replacing the stores with a roller skating rink, movie theater or a park to help entertain young people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The idea rang hollow to Frank LaMere, a Native American activist who has fought for 18 years to close the stores. LaMere said the beer store owners shouldn't be rewarded with a payout and wants the state to revoke their liquor licenses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Whiteclay sadly continues to be the golden goose to many,"" LaMere said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On a recent day in the Whiteclay, some people were passed out on garbage-strewn sidewalks or begging for change. Others loitered on the streets or in abandoned houses littered with dirty blankets and empty beer cans. Some people wandered along the side of the main highway through town, Nebraska Highway 87, which leads into the reservation, past 1970s-era federal housing, decrepit mobile homes and abandoned cars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lance Moss, a Whiteclay grocery store owner who does not sell alcohol, said he didn't know if the town would change substantially if the beer stores were sold. Moss said some regular visitors might congregate in Whiteclay and buy beer from bootleggers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Obviously, all the beer that's sold in Whiteclay is going to get sold someplace else,"" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Nebraska Liquor Control Commission is set to meet March 7 to discuss the stores' liquor licenses amid complaints that the village lacks adequate law enforcement. Last month, the local county board with jurisdiction over Whiteclay recommended that the state renew the licenses, partially amid concerns that closing the stores would lead to an increase of intoxicated drivers in Nebraska. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives of two of the Whiteclay beer stores, Stateline Liquor and Arrowhead Inn, declined to comment because of their pending cases before the liquor commission. Attempts to reach the owners of the Jumping Eagle Inn and D&S Pioneer Service weren't immediately successful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ministry's new effort is called ""B.O.B.S.

Lazarre pointed to a $2,000 mattress, and Schumer immediately bought it for her, per WGN. Schumer, who identified herself as an actress and comedian, ""told me she wanted to buy it for me"" as a thank you for letting her use the bathroom, Lazarre says.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PREVIOUS: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What an embarrassment for Fox Sports, the U.S. Open and United States Golf Association. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fox Sports is profusely apologizing for inadvertently broadcasting rough sex talk between two U.S. Open fans Friday at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. The offensive chatter was picked up by one of Fox's 200-plus, omnipresent on-course microphones, then mistakenly broadcast to millions of TV viewers watching FS1's coverage of Round 2 of the 2018 U.S. Open. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Today, during the live FS1 broadcast of the 2018 U.S. Open, one of the many microphones on the course inadvertently picked up some offensive crowd chatter. We sincerely apologize,"" Fox Sports spokeswoman Anne Pennington said in a statement to Sporting News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When SN asked Pennington if the offensive audio came from fans on the course or a radio mixup, Pennington confirmed it came from the gallery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The conversation, involving an unidentified man bragging about how he violently head-butted his ""bitch"" ex, was captured by Awful Announcing. (WARNING: The link goes to an article containing extremely graphic and NSFW audio.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fox's Joe Buck was discussing Masters winner Patrick Reed when Fox's viewers suddenly heard two new voices discussing sex. After they had finished, Buck came back on the air as if nothing had happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To cap Fox's freaky Friday, the audio cut out for eight minutes during its afternoon coverage from the historic course in Southampton, N.Y., on Long Island. To his credit, Buck handled the sound snafu with aplomb, noting: ""The reviews are in. We've never sounded better."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During its first four years of USGA coverage, Fox has liberally sprinkled on-course microphones around the greens, tee boxes, fairways and galleries to bring viewers the sights and sounds of a U.S. Open. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Sporting News warned Thursday that some of the gavones in the loud, proud New York crowd would give Fox more audio than it could handle: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It's hard to blame Fox for spectators running their yaps.

Still, the mics picking up these gavones hurt the broadcast. As a viewer, I found it distracting to hear that stuff on nearly every hole, every shot."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next question is how the strait-laced, white-shoe crowd at the USGA will react to its premier event being sullied by Fox's X-rated, misogynistic audio. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We'll see this weekend.","The US Open broadcast on Fox Sports took a strange turn Friday when a microphone inadvertently picked up a guy bragging about rough sex with his ""ex,"" the Sporting News reports. Announcer Joe Buck was setting up a shot by golfer Patrick Reed at around 1:45pm EST when the surprise voices emerged. ""Here at one, it's Patrick Reed,"" said Buck, and a mic picked up a man talking to his male companion, per Awful Announcing. ""We were ---ing so hard, and I headbutted her in the head,"" the man said, among other things, but the other doesn't sound convinced: ""Yeah, what actually happened, pal?"" The first one protests, ""No, straight up..."" and his words soon turn indistinct. Buck's voice returned with ""second shot,"" as if all was normal, and the broadcast continued. ""From the sound, it seems likely this was a radio conversation that somehow got picked up onto the actual feed, rather than just crowd chatter, but we don’t know for sure,"" says Awful Announcing.

The judge ordered the company to pay more than $800K in attorney's fees, but the lawyer's haven't gotten their loot.So apparently the crafty lawyers are trying to get their money from the people -- including Pat -- who bought condos on the ship.

Investors ended up suing the company building the ship, and the company lost; it was ordered to pay $800,000 in legal costs but allegedly never did, so now the investors are going after people who purchased the condos—including, in TMZ's telling, Boone, hence the court appearance. But Boone says he was nothing more than a celebrity spokesman for the would-be ship, and he doesn't seem too concerned about the whole thing, saying he does plan to get himself to court and telling TMZ, ""Is this the way Lindsay Lohan and Robert Downey got so famous?"""
"An interesting historical fashion footnote: Thom Browne criticized President Obama’s wardrobe in a 2010 WSJ magazine interview. He said in the interview: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Obama could be dressed so much better. It looks like his clothing just doesn’t fit him. What is he doing? He’s a politician. My brother is a politician, and unfortunately they are too concerned that their constituents will not appreciate them looking better than everyone else. As opposed to thinking, “I should dress well because that’s what people want to see.” I saw a documentary on the Queen Mum during the war and she still dressed to go out and see the people because they expected it. They wanted to see a queen. They didn’t want to see her looking like them.”  In 2009 Chief Justice John Roberts flipped some very important words in President Obama's swearing-in. Four years later, it appears the two still haven't figured out how to do get this tradition quite right. Here's the big ""oops"" moment from today's inauguration: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The office of the president of the United Sta—"" is the flub, if you can call it that.

Today the oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, went off a little more smoothly than it did during Obama's first inauguration, though the AtlanticWire points out it wasn't error-free. And the flub this time was Obama's. While reciting the phrase ""The office of the president of the United States,"" he effectively choked on the last word, saying just ""Sta—,"" and making a little face after doing so. In other oath-taking tidbits, the president placed his hand on two Bibles: one Abraham Lincoln's and the other Martin Luther King's. (Prof. Cornel West wasn't thrilled about the latter choice, notes the National Review: West slammed the use of King's ""prophetic fire as just a moment in presidential pageantry."") Joe Biden, meanwhile, again took the oath from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Wall Street Journal notes.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trial continues.  1.51pm BST NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the hearing over for the day, it's time for a closing summary. This will be very similar to the lunchtime summary, as we only had about 45 minutes of evidence in the afternoon: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Oscar Pistorius has taken to the witness stand to begin giving evidence in his murder trial. He began with a tearful, broken-voiced apology to the family and friends of Reeva Steenkamp, his girlfriend who he shot in February last year, believing – he says – she was an intruder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Pistorius said there is ""not a moment"" when he does not think about her family, and prays for them daily. He added: ""I've tried to put my words on paper many times to write to you but no words would ever suffice"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Pistorius said he had taken anti-depressants and sleeping pills since the shooting, often waking with ""terrible nightmares"" in which he dreamed he could smell blood. He said he often calls his sister to sit with him during the night. On one occasion he climbed into a cupboard to call her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • He said his religious faith was the only thing to sustain him over the past year: ""There have been times when I've just been struggling a lot. My God is a God of refuge."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Pistorius spoke at length about his fear about, and experience of, crime. He said his his mother was worried about intruders and kept a pistol under her pillow NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Pistorius said a speedboat accident in 2009 which almost killed him left him fearful and withdrawn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Earlier, the first defence witness was a pathologist, Prof Jan Botha, who questioned prosecution evidence that Steenkamp must have eaten about two hours before her death at 3am, something which runs counter to Pistorius's statement that they went to bed at 10pm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Botha was questioned aggressively and at length by the prosecution counsel, Gerrie Nel, giving a taste of the likely cross-examination Pistorius will face. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • While this evidence was heard, including details of Steenkamp's injuries and photos of wounds and blood, Pistorius spent much of the time with his hands over his face, also retching.","Oscar Pistorius' defense team is launching its case, and yet again, the testimony seems to have been too much for the athlete to take. Pistorius threw up multiple times—now a frequent occurrence—into a bucket as a forensic pathologist discussed the bullet wounds that killed Reeva Steenkamp, Reuters reports. The pathologist, Jannie Botha, agreed with the state pathologist regarding the sequence of shots that hit Steenkamp. A sobbing Pistorius and others in the court couldn't bear to look at graphic photos displayed, NBC News notes. Next, Pistorius himself took the witness stand and began by apologizing to Steenkamp's family. ""There is not a moment and there hasn't been a moment since this tragedy happened that I haven't thought about your family,"" he said, struggling to speak clearly through emotion. Other noteworthy moments, via the Guardian: Pistorius said he has trouble sleeping. ""I have terrible nightmares about what happened that night. I wake up and I can smell blood."" He often calls his sister for help, once doing so from inside a cupboard, he said. He added that he never wanted to touch a gun again. He discussed his close relationship with his mother and her sudden death when he was a teenager.

Autos NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That kid—the one in the back of the SUV with the iPad—is the automotive industry’s worst enemy. He’s also the reason some of the world’s biggest automakers are working with Google to bring its Android software into vehicle infotainment systems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early this morning, Google (GOOG) announced the Open Automotive Alliance. It’s a group of technology and automotive companies, including General Motors (GM), Honda Motor (HMC), Audi, Hyundai, and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), that want to customize Google’s popular mobile operating system for vehicles. The technology companies get a chance to place their wares into hundreds of millions of cars. Meanwhile, the automakers have an opportunity to modernize the software inside their vehicles and try to keep pace with the mobile devices that are starting to make high-profit infotainment systems obsolete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The announcement comes the day before the official opening of the International Consumer Electronics Show held this week in Las Vegas, where the theme of car-as-gadget (also called “the connected car”) is expected to dominate. Volkswagen’s (VOW) Audi unit and GM are among the slate of auto companies at CES, which is promoting the growth of car-related exhibits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Car companies have traditionally rejected the latest and greatest gizmos, preferring stable, proven technology. It’s a stance that makes sense given the safety and reliability concerns they face. The rise and rapid evolution of smartphones and tablets, however, has put a great deal of pressure on these automotive traditions. The mapping services that come free with smartphones have become a compelling alternative to pricey built-in navigation systems. Similarly, a parent might prefer to hand a child a tablet or phone loaded with movies, games, and apps rather than rely on a single DVD playing on backseat screens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, carmakers have largely responded with custom in-car software systems. Ford Motor (F) and Microsoft (MSFT) collaborated on MyFord Touch, which ties cars to mobile devices and allows for things like voice commands. Other carmakers use the QNX software acquired by BlackBerry (BBRY), homegrown software, or variants of the Linux operating system. While the strategy helps car companies create products that differ from their rivals’, it also requires software companies to write different applications for each carmaker—a costly and time-consuming process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There have already been attempts to solve this problem through partnerships. In 2009, BMW, GM, Intel (INTC), and others, for example, announced the Genivi Alliance, a stab at collaborating around the Linux operating system and supporting software that has had modest results. (Genivi is sponsoring a panel at CES called, alarmingly, “Collaborate or Die” (PDF).) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Android, a variant of Linux, has an advantage over other software because of its dominance in the mobile device industry. The electronics and computing supply chain throughout Asia, Europe, and the U.S. tends to test and tune new components first for Android, providing intense interest and deep expertise around the software. For the automakers, this could translate into access to newer, better technology and lower costs for testing equipment. App makers are also used to creating software for Android. In addition, the likes of BMW, Kia, Audi, and Toyota Motor (TM) already use Google technology for search, maps, and other functions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tesla Motors (TSLA) is among the cutting-edge automakers that have popularized the notion of a computer on wheels as the next evolution of the car. The company’s all-electric Model S sedan ships with a 17-inch touch screen and ready access to things like streaming radio. With a few finger swipes, you can split the screen to have a massive top section for Google Maps and a lower section for music. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, new companies like CloudCar are working to bridge the technology and automotive realms. The company has built a small computing device that can be plugged into a car to give it a modern infotainment system. The idea is that automakers could then upgrade the small unit as needed to bring new features to their vehicles. In addition, software makers would have a common device to aim at with their applications. Ford has also set up a research center in Palo Alto and open-sourced some of the innards of its cars’ control software to let people create things like custom speedometers.","The big news from the Consumer Electronics Show—where the expected theme is ""the connected car""—is a plan to make your new vehicle a little more like your smartphone. General Motors and Audi tell the Wall Street Journal they have plans to give their vehicles built-in 4G high-speed broadband, and the services sound pretty cool: GM says it'll offer weather and music apps, viewable on an in-dash screen, plus a Vehicle Health app for troubleshooting problems with the car itself. But that's only the beginning of what Google calls the Open Automotive Alliance: a teaming with automotive companies to bring Google's Android system to the road, Businessweek reports. Honda and Hyundai are also in on the deal, while Nvidia will make the chips for automotive displays. But you'll have to pay up for the services, expected later this year, and automakers are already being met with grumbling about distracted drivers. ""To take mobile technology and give the driver distractions that don't even relate to driving is just not the right direction,"" a National Safety Council director said, adding, ""I don't blame the automakers, but they are now in an arms race to be more connected."" With those complaints in mind, automakers are working to integrate technology so as to be ""glanceable."" As an Nvidia rep says, ""Holding a phone and interacting with a phone while driving is just not safe."""

"It's unclear why Britain's NME would have their hands on a new poem by Jay-Z, but if they do, and it's real, Hova's done dropping the word bitch thanks to newborn daughter Blue Ivy Carter. The poem is said to sport lines like: ""Before I got in the game, made a change, and got rich/I didn’t think hard about using the word bitch/I rapped, I flipped it, I sold it, I lived it/Now with my daughter in this world I curse those that give it."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the B-word is on its way out of the repertoire, Uncle Kanye has to be psyched he got his big bro to cosign Watch the Throne's ""That's My Bitch"" less than a year before Baby Blue came along. Jay's near-whisper of the hook on that track could've hinted at this decision, yet we're still reeling.  Beyonce and Jay-Z may be some of the biggest names on the planet but that doesn't mean they'll pass up on any dirty work now they've become parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking in her first interview since giving birth to daughter Blue Ivy, Beyonce has spoken of how her and Jay-Z will be bringing her up in a ""normal loving family"". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And yep, that means even Jay-Z - who Bey says will be an ""inspirational father"" - will be changing Blue's dirty nappies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""He will change diapers, of course he will,"" the singer told Star magazine. ""He's going to be a very hands-on father and he is going to be so good at it.

"The mystery author has set ""O: A Presidential Novel"" during the ""presidential election of 2012"" and mixes fact with fiction. Amazon NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR W NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ashington is abuzz with rumors about O, a speculative novel about the Obama presidency penned by ""Anonymous."" Publisher Simon & Schuster says only that the shadowy scribe has ""been in the room with Barack Obama"" and has ""spent years observing politics."" Set in the future during the 2012 presidential election, the 368-page novel is said to mix fiction with reality — much like ""Primary Colors,"" the 1996 novel about Bill Clinton published anonymously by journalist Joe Klein. Beltway pundits are desperate to identify the mystery author before the novel hits shelves later this month. Who are the frontrunners? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Joe Klein NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Could Klein, now a columnist at Time, have played the same trick again? asks Lloyd Grove at The Daily Beast. Klein says he didn't: ""You get to do that only once in a lifetime, I think."" Uh, the last time Klein ""vehemently denied his involvement"" in an anonymous political novel, says Juli Weiner at Vanity Fair, ""it turned out he did write [it]."" Why believe him now? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Robert Gibbs NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the other hand, the publishers' description of the author ""fits Gibbs to a T,"" says Grove, and it is ""at minimum, an intriguing coincidence"" that the White House press secretary chose to resign just a few weeks before the book's publication. That said, Gibbs has been ""rather busy"" over the last two years, and ""literary flair"" isn't his strong suit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Rahm Emanuel NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While ""the smart money is on Klein, the optimistic money is on former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel,"" says The Guardian, though ""Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert"" are also possibilities. Sarah Palin or Glenn Beck? Less likely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Ben Smith NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Politico correspondent Ben Smith has been leading a hunt for the anonymous author on his blog, where he and colleague Byron Tau have gathered denials from, among others, Bill Ayers, David Axelrod, David Plouffe, former White House Communications Director Anita Dunn, and New York Times columnist David Brooks. But what about Smith himself? asks Ben Grossman-Cohen at Aggregate Appeal. He fits the description, and has ""publicized the upcoming release on multiple occasions."" Sorry, responds Smith. ""I didn't do it."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. President Obama NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brian Stelter of The New York Times tells Politico that ""Obama himself, ever insistent on controlling his narrative... [may have] penned the book."" Is it ""far-fetched"" to think the president — an ""established bestselling author"" — is responsible? asks Lloyd Grove at The Daily Beast. ""Sure. But it's a possibility worth considering."" Not if you're White House spokesperson Bill Burton, who declined to comment on the speculation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6. President Obama's teleprompter NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the author ""knows Obama intimately,"" sums up Prudence at The Prudence Paine Papers, ""tells Obama what to do,"" and ""has written for Obama."" The answer is obvious, surely? The ""TOTUS"" — that is, the ""teleprompter of the United States."" Mystery solved.  I made it through ""O: A Presidential Novel"" last night, a quick read because the publisher vastly oversold its insight into presidential character and undersold the degree to which it's a fast, well-plotted bit of campaign fiction, an honorable genre, bogged down only at times by too much campaign detail. You get the sense the author read ""Game Change,"" not ""What It Takes"", before sitting down to write, and while ""O"" doesn't reach the depth of either nonfiction book, it takes the former's pace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But its real calling card is the author's anonymity, and there's some fun to be had on those terms. For one thing, the author has a real grasp of campaigns -- but mostly as far as campaigns' relations with the press go, which suggests the author's either a political reporter or a press staffer of some sort. There's a newsroom based on POLITICO, but the surly, micro-managing editor there seems to be based on another, specific person whom I can't place. The author also has a solid grasp of Obamaland, with the obvious characters like David Axelrod (Avi Samuelson) sketched clearly, and another character, who seems to be a composite of people I can guess at, in the role of a spurned but loyal Chicago Obama protege. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two other specific data points: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR -The author really doesn't like Arianna Huffington. The author seems to have had more fun writing her stand-in, Bianca Stefani, than anyone else in the book. A former ""courtesan to the wealthy and powerful"" she's ""infamously changeable"" and disloyal, with just ""one abiding passion: her own notoriety."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR -A character's mother has a bone marrow disease called myelodysplastic syndrome, a fairly specific choice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's not all that much to go on, but then the book doesn't reveal all that much. Check out Ron Charles' lovely Washington Post review for more, and let me know if you spot more clues.","O: A Presidential Novel is not the gossipy bombshell one might have expected of a novel, penned anonymously by an insider, depicting the 2012 Obama campaign, writes Ron Charles for the Washington Post. In fact, it suffers a bit in that the fictionalized Obama and his GOP opponent—a flattering blend of John McCain and Mitt Romney, devoid of demagoguery—are relatively respectful of each other. In a way, the book is ""an uncanny response to this month's call for a more civil political discourse."" All in all, it's like presidential candidates themselves: Not ""as good as you hoped or as bad as you feared."" So who wrote it? Ben Smith, writing for Politico, notes that the author clearly knows the mechanics of political campaigns well, but mainly from the standpoint of the press, which suggests either a political reporter or a campaign staffer with experience in PR. Another hint: the author seems to hate Arianna Huffington. Check out the Week for 6 theories on the author's identity."

"If all goes well, the Curiosity rover will be on the Mars surface at about 1:17 a.m. Eastern time, and 13 minutes, 48 seconds later (the time it takes for a radio signal to travel 154 million miles to Earth from Mars), there will be confirmation and cheering in the control room at 1:31 a.m., give or take a minute or so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Or there could be silence – nothing from the rover, and probably a somber pall in mission control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it would not necessarily mean that the Curiosity had come to a quick, unfortunate demise. It could just be an interplanetary communications glitch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are several transmitters on the spacecraft that will broadcast at different frequencies. Using one of them, the so-called X-band, the Curiosity will send simple messages directly to Earth. But, a couple of minutes before landing, the landing site at Gale Crater will rotate out of view from Earth – that means the direct communications path will be blocked, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, the spacecraft will be broadcasting a wealth a data using a UHF antenna. That is not powerful enough to be picked up by antenna on Earth, but a NASA orbiter, Mars Odyssey, will act as a relay, re-transmitting the data to Earth in real-time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If anything goes wrong with the Curiosity-to-Odyssey-to-Earth communications, then the result will be silence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That is not inconceivable, especially as Odyssey experienced a malfunction two months ago with one of three spinning wheels used to orient the spacecraft. A spare wheel was put into operation, but if it turns out that Odyssey cannot turn itself toward Curiosity, it will not hear anything. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Odyssey misses Curiosity’s messages, a second orbiter, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, will also be listening. But Reconnaissance Orbiter will be recording the data, not relaying it, and engineers on Earth will not get to sift through that information until hours later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If silence persists, the two orbiters will make additional passes over Curiosity over the next day, and late on Monday, the Curiosity will be able to talk directly to Earth, bypassing the orbiters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA engineers said it is quite possible for Curiosity to land successfully and that they would not find out for hours. Once they establish contact, the mission proceeds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But if a full day passes without hearing from Curiosity, then pessimism will set in that something had gone terribly wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR — KENNETH CHANG  That landing is scheduled for 1:31 a.m., and officials said they could know almost immediately if the rover was safely on the ground. That tracking would come from the Odyssey orbiter circling Mars, if the spacecraft is able to get to the right location at the right time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If not, the waiting time for a final answer on whether the rover was safely on the surface could range from two to eight hours. If no signal arrives from Curiosity via three Mars orbiters and the Deep Space Network after 18 hours, NASA officials said, then they would start to worry about its safety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The final descent has been pre-programmed and the army of engineers and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Lab’s Mission Control have no control over it. “Our position will be identical to anyone at home,” said Adam Steltzner, lead of the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) team. “We’re all along for the ride.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking for the team as a whole, Steltzner said they were “Rationally confident, emotionally terrified and ready for EDL.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the rover is so much larger, more complicated and more ambitious than earlier models, it has to land in a new and far more hazardous way. The landing, which could never be tested in full on Earth, includes a hovering rocket stage, a kind of sky crane, to lower it to the ground. NASA’s chief scientist John Grunsfeld has said that because of that heightened landing difficulty, in addition to the unprecedented sophistication of the instruments on board, Curiosity is “the most important NASA mission of the decade.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worldwide spectacle NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Curiosity landing is shaping up to be an international spectacle. Formal “landing” parties have been scheduled from South Australia to Rome, from Israel to Crete; and in the United States from Atlanta to Seattle, Milwaukee to Honolulu. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA also has helped organize a landing gathering in New York’s Times Square, which will feature a large screen that will beam the streaming news from atop a building and high above the crowd. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reaching, orbiting and landing on Mars is notoriously hard. In addition to the European Space Agency, nations including the United States, the former Soviet Union, Russia, the European Space Agency, China and Japan have sent missions to Mars since the late 1960s, but only about one-third of them have succeeded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States is the only nation to land a vehicle on Mars and complete its mission, having done it six out of seven tries.","The Curiosity rover landed safely on Mars early this morning, prompting whoops of joy and relief in NASA's mission control center, reports the New York Times. The rover quickly beamed back a picture of its own shadow cast on the surface of the Red Planet. ""Touchdown confirmed. We are safe on the surface of Mars!"" the team read out after receiving signals from the rover. After a journey of 354 million miles, the rover, which is much bigger and more complex than previous models, had to land in a new way that could never be fully tested on Earth, leading to what control room staff described as ""seven minutes of terror"" before confirmation was received, notes the Washington Post. As earlier reported, the spacecraft ferrying it had to rely on a supersonic parachute to slow it from 13,200mph to about 1.7mph; with seconds to go, the rover was then lowered to the surface using three nylon tethers and retro rockets."

"Importance Suicide is a leading cause of death among school-aged children younger than 12 years but little is known about the epidemiology of suicide in this age group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Objective To describe trends in suicide among US children younger than 12 years by sociodemographic group and method of death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Design, Setting, and Participants Period trend analysis of national mortality data on suicide in children aged 5 to 11 years in the United States from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 2012. Data were analyzed per 5-year periods, between 1993 to 1997 and 2008 to 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Main Outcomes and Measures Number of suicide deaths and crude suicide rates. Period trends in rates of suicide were estimated using negative binomial regression incidence rate ratios (IRRs). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results The overall suicide rate among children aged 5 to 11 years remained stable between 1993 to 1997 and 2008 to 2012 (from 1.18 to 1.09 per 1 million; IRR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.03). However, the suicide rate increased significantly in black children (from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million; IRR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11-1.45) and decreased in white children (from 1.14 to 0.77 per 1 million; IRR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94). The overall firearm suicide rate (IRR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.85) and firearm suicide rate among white boys (IRR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.88) decreased significantly during the study. The rate of suicide by hanging/suffocation increased significantly in black boys (IRR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.14-1.61), although the overall change in suicide rates by hanging/suffocation or other suicide methods did not change during the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conclusions and Relevance The stable overall suicide rate in school-aged children in the United States during 20 years of study obscured a significant increase in suicide incidence in black children and a significant decrease in suicide incidence among white children. Findings highlight a potential racial disparity that warrants attention. Further studies are needed to monitor these emerging trends and identify risk, protective, and precipitating factors relevant to suicide prevention efforts in children younger than 12 years.  The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public.  The overall suicide rate among children between the ages of five and 11 was stable during the 20 years from 1993 to 2012, but that stability obscured racial differences that show an increase in suicide among black children and a decrease among white children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For a study published by JAMA Pediatrics, researchers led by Jeffrey A. Bridge, Ph.D., of the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, analyzed 20 years of nationwide mortality data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers found that 657 children between the ages of five and 11 died by suicide between 1993 and 2012 — an average of nearly 33 children each year. They also found that 553 (84 percent) of the children were boys and 104 (16 percent) were girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hanging/suffocation was the predominant method of suicide, accounting for 78.2 percent (514 of 657) of the total suicides, followed by firearms (17.7 percent; 116 of 657) and other methods (4.1 percent; 27 of 657), according to the results. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The analysis showed that the overall suicide rate remained stable during the 20-year period, going from 1.18 per one million to 1.09 per million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the researchers found that that stability resulted from divergent trends in suicide for black and white children during those 20 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suicide rate increased in black children from 1.36 per one million to 2.54 per one million, while the suicide rate decreased in white children from 1.14 per one million to 0.77 per one million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statistically significant racial differences were confined to both black and white boys, with an increase in the suicide rate among black boys (1.78 to 3.47 per one million) and a decrease in the suicide rate among white boys (from 1.96 to 1.31 per one million). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the changes were not statistically significant among girls, the suicide rate among black girls increased from 0.68 to 1.23 per one million during the 20-year period, while the suicide rate among white girls remained stable from 0.25 to 0.24 per one million, according to the study’s findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the researchers, the findings prompt questions about what factors might influence increasing suicide rates among young black children, such as disproportionate exposure to violence and traumatic stress, aggressive school discipline, and an early onset of puberty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the researchers said it remains unclear if any of these factors are related to increasing suicide rates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The stable overall suicide rate among U.S. children aged five to 11 years during 20 years of study masked a significant increase in the suicide rate among black children and a significant decline in the suicide rate among white children,” the authors write. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “From a public health perspective, future steps should include ongoing surveillance to monitor these emerging trends and research to identify risk, protective and precipitating factors associated with suicide in elementary school-aged children to frame targets for early detection and culturally informed interventions.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Source: The JAMA Network Journals","It has to rank among the saddest of studies: a new look at suicides among young children. Researchers reviewed two decades of CDC data, from 1993 to 2012. Though they write in JAMA Pediatrics that ""suicide is a leading cause of death among school-aged children younger than 12 years,"" they found that suicides among those ages 5 to 11 are very rare, reports the AP: There were 657 during the period studied, or one roughly every week-and-a-half (per the CDC, the daily average for all ages is 105 suicides). But while the suicide rate remained stable during that time, ""that stability obscured racial differences,"" observes Psych Central. The suicide rate decreased in white children, but increased significantly in black children, from from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million between the study's first five years and its last five. (In white children, the shift was from 1.14 to 0.77.) That shot suicide up from No. 14 on the list of causes of death among black kids of this age to No. 9; it's No. 11 for white kids. The researchers noted that 84% of those who committed suicide were boys and just 16% girls, and the rate worsens when viewed through a gender lens as well. For black boys, the rate climbed to 3.47 per million. The findings represent a big shift, per lead author Jeffrey Bridge. ""Historically, the suicide rate among US black individuals has been lower than that of white individuals across age groups,"" reads the study. ""To our knowledge, this is the first national study to observe higher suicide rates among US black individuals compared with white individuals."" Hanging and suffocation were the main methods for young children. Bridge advises parents to look for warning signs like prolonged unhappiness and withdrawing from favorite activities.

"During his surprise comedy skit at the Emmys on Sunday, Sean Spicer may have made light of his six-month tenure as the White House press secretary, but a message was also embedded in his performance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview on Monday morning, Mr. Spicer said he now regrets one of his most infamous moments as press secretary: his decision to charge into the White House briefing room in January and criticize accurate news reports that President Barack Obama’s inauguration crowd was bigger than President Trump’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Of course I do, absolutely,” Mr. Spicer said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Mr. Spicer, who resigned this summer after repeated clashes with the news media and a sharp disagreement with Mr. Trump over the appointment of Anthony Scaramucci as communications director, the Emmys were his latest attempt to court the largely liberal coastal entertainment and news elites he so acidly disdained as the president’s alter-ego spokesman. The once-obscure party spokesman has been elevated to a level of celebrity he scarcely dreamed possible a year ago. And, like many before him, he hopes to translate his embattled tenure into something more lasting and lucrative. So the Emmys were also a chance for Mr. Spicer to cultivate a television industry audience that he may need as he seeks speaking engagements and paid television appearances in his post-White House life.  Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘In the Spirit of Sean Spicer’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The internet was ablaze on Monday with debate over whether the Emmys broadcast — and the after-parties that followed — had helped rehabilitate the image of the former White House press secretary Sean Spicer. James Corden was in one of the most incriminating photographs, caught trying to give Mr. Spicer a kiss on the cheek. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On “The Late Late Show” on Monday, Mr. Corden first tried denying it, taking a page from the Spicer-Trump playbook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Now, I know you think that’s a picture of me kissing Sean Spicer, but in the spirit of Sean Spicer, no, it isn’t.” — JAMES CORDEN NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then he tried an excuse: He’d been too inebriated to know what he was doing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Anyone ever have that feeling when you get a little drunk and then wake up the next morning and think, ‘Oh, God, who did I kiss last night?’ It’s a bit like that.” — JAMES CORDEN “To be fair, everyone was kissing ass last night, I just happened to kiss the biggest one there.” — JAMES CORDEN NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, Mr. Corden showed about a dozen images of himself kissing other celebrities, suggesting that he hadn’t given any special love to Mr. Spicer (nor shown any particular restraint around him). “Basically, what I’m saying is, I need to learn how to shake hands,” Mr. Corden said.  Washington (CNN) Sean Spicer said ""of course"" he regrets the time he trashed the press for reporting accurately on President Donald Trump's Inauguration Day crowd, The New York Times reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Of course I do, absolutely,"" the former White House press secretary told the newspaper Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The day after Trump's inauguration, the President sent Spicer into the briefing room to dispute the true size of the crowd he drew at the inauguration. Side-by-side photos showed a larger gathering for former President Barack Obama, but Spicer declared , ""This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Times did not state specifically the wording of the question Spicer was responding to. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spicer, in a late-night show following his resignation, said that interaction in the briefing room was not ""probably the best start."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump, said Spicer was using ""alternative facts"" when he disputed the inauguration coverage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spicer's latest comments came a day after he played a prominent role in the Emmy Awards, taking the stage and mocking the first comments he made in the White House briefing room as the President's principal spokesman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""This will be the largest audience to witness the Emmys, period -- both in person and around the world,"" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spicer, who resigned when Trump tapped Anthony Scaramucci for what became a brief stint as communications director, drew controversy on the job for his misleading statements and confrontational approach to the press corps.","Days before Sean Spicer appeared at the Emmys, Stephen Colbert suggested the former White House press secretary shouldn't be forgiven for lying to the public. ""He wants to be forgiven, but he won't regret anything he did,"" Colbert said on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday. ""You got to regret something you did to be forgiven."" After a busy weekend in Hollywood, however, Spicer is 'fessing up to one major regret, reports the New York Times. Asked Monday if he regretted blasting journalists for accurately reporting that President Trump's inauguration crowd was smaller than former President Obama's—then claiming Trump's ""was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period""—Spicer replied, ""Of course I do, absolutely."" The comment followed Spicer's much-debated appearance at the Emmys, in which he claimed, ""This will be the largest audience to witness the Emmys, period,"" per CNN. He says he hopes Trump isn't offended. It was ""an attempt to poke a little fun at myself and add a bit of levity to the event,"" says Spicer, who wore a disguise as he traveled from Washington to Los Angeles. The Times points out the appearance was also an opportunity for Spicer ""to cultivate a television industry audience that he may need as he seeks speaking engagements and paid television appearances in his post-White House life."" So far so good: Guests afterward lined up to get a photo with the former press secretary. James Corden was even seen kissing him, per the Times."

My friends at CAA have been asking me for 7 years when they can take offers seriously. Gave them the green light."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CAA refers to the talent agency that represents him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As The Hollywood Reporter points out, Schwarzenegger, who is best known for his ""Terminator"" films, took on a number of bit parts in films throughout his governorship. Those included the 2004 ""Around the World in 80 Days"" remake, as well as summer 2010's action extravaganza ""The Expendables."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schwarzenegger had previously mused on his film return, saying that he was reading and considering three different scripts. One would see him star as a kind hearted Nazi soldier that eschews orders to kill a group of kids, instead returning them to safety. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That sounds action-packed, but he's realistic about his big screen limitations this time around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""In the future I have to adapt my roles to my age,"" he told an Austrian newspaper. ""Clint Eastwood also has done it in the same way.

He even committed it to concrete at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood when his handprints and footprints were enshrined there as a major star of major motion pictures.Now those words may apply to him again. Schwarzenegger may return to the big screen.With the exception of some cameo roles like the one in the 2010 movie ""The Expendables,"" Schwarzenegger has not had parts in any movies since he was elected governor of California in October 2003. In recent years, the Republican has had his hands full as California and the rest of the United States have struggled through the recession.When Schwarzenegger first took office as governor, his popularity was high and there was even chatter about the possibility of a run for the presidency. As President Barack Obama and his opponents known as ""birthers"" are well aware, a citizen must have been born in the United States to be eligible for the job.Although Schwarzenegger, who was born in Austria, would be ineligible for the presidency, legislation has been introduced at various times to amend the Constitution to allow residents who have lived in the United States for at least 20 or 25 years to become commander in chief, assuming they win the election. One bill, introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, even became known as ""the Schwarzenegger amendment.""But talk of higher office has subsided. Although he had favorability ratings of 79 percent in 2003, according to the Gallup Poll, his approval rating fell to 25 percent in January, according to Public Policy Polling.And Schwarzenegger has indicated that he would like to return to Hollywood. In a Twitter post on Thursday, he made a reference to the Creative Artists Agency, where his agents work, writing:Funny, he didn't think to use his catchphrase in the post.","Arnold Schwarzenegger apparently meant it when he said, ""I'll be back:"" The ex-Governator is picking up his old day job, acting, reports the AP.

"Swiss mountaineer Erhard Loretan, one of the few climbers to have summited all 14 of the world's peaks above 8,000 meters (26,247 feet), died in a climbing accident on Thursday, his 52nd birthday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Associated Press reported that Loretan was leading a Swiss client up the summit ridge of the Gruenhorn, in the Bernese Alps, when the pair fell for unknown reasons at a height of 3,800 meters (12,500 feet) up the 4,043 meter (13,264-foot) peak. Police from the Swiss canton of Valais said that Loretan died at the scene, while his 38-year-old client was flown to a hospital in serious condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Loretan, originally from the canton of Fribourg, began climbing at age 11. He ascended his first 8,000-meter peak, Pakistan's Nanga Parbat, in 1982.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Loretan was the third person, behind Italian climber Reinhold Messner and Polish mountaineer Jerry Kukuczka, to summit all the 8,000-meter peaks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Loretan was also renowned for his 1986 ascent of Mt. Everest in only 40 hours, climbing by night without the use of supplementary oxygen.

"In this undated photo provided by Maritime New Zealand, the yacht Nina is tied at dock at a unidentified location. Searchers said Thursday, June 27, 2013, they have grave concerns for seven people aboard... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A New Zealand meteorologist took the last known calls from the seven people aboard an American schooner, ""The weather's turned nasty, how do we get away from it?"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The phone calls and texts ended June 4. More than three weeks later, searchers said Thursday they have grave concerns for the crew on the classic 85-year-old wooden vessel that went missing while sailing from New Zealand to Australia. Attempts to contact the crew by radio and an aerial search this week have proved fruitless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say the skipper of the 70-foot (21-meter) vessel Nina is American David Dyche. They say there are two other American men and three American women aboard, aged between 17 and 73. Also aboard is a British man, aged 35. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Messages posted online by friends indicate the boat originally left from Panama City, Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meteorologist Bob McDavitt said he took a satellite phone call from the boat June 3. A woman named Evi asked how to get away from the weather. He said to call back in 30 minutes after he'd studied a forecast. She did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""She was quite controlled in her voice, it sounded like everything was under control,"" McDavitt said, adding that the call itself indicated she was concerned about the conditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McDavitt said he spoke only briefly to Evi, advising her to head south and to brace for a storm with strong winds and high seas. The next day he got a text, the last known communication from the boat: ""ANY UPDATE 4 NINA? ... EVI"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McDavitt said he advised the crew to stay put and ride out the storm another day. He continued sending messages the next few days but didn't hear back. Friends of the crew got in touch with McDavitt soon after that, and then alerted authorities June 14. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kevin Banaghan, who is spearheading search efforts by Maritime New Zealand's Rescue Coordination Centre, said rescuers weren't worried at first because there had been no distress call from the boat and its emergency locator beacon had not been activated. He said rescuers on June 14 initiated a communications search, in which they tried contacting the boat over various radio frequencies as well as contacting other vessels in the area to see if they'd spotted the Nina. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This week, he said, rescuers escalated their efforts. An Air Force plane on Tuesday searched the area where the boat went missing. A second search by the plane on Wednesday went as far as the Australian coast but again turned up nothing. Banaghan said searchers are considering their next options. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The boat left the Bay of Islands in northern New Zealand on May 29 bound for the port of Newcastle, near Sydney. The last communication was from 370 nautical miles west of New Zealand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Banaghan said the crew hoped to arrive in Australia mid-June but that, given the conditions, he considered a realistic arrival date to be about June 25. He said Dyche is a qualified captain and the crew has varying degrees of experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We're very concerned for their safety and wellbeing,"" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say the storm three weeks ago saw winds gusting up to 110 kilometers (68 miles) per hour and waves of up to 8 meters (26 feet). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Banaghan said the Nina is a ""lovely old craft"" which won races when it was new and had been maintained in excellent condition. He added that it had a new engine installed in recent months which had apparently created some initial leaking problems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said there are several possible scenarios, including the boat losing communications, drifting off course, or the crew taking to lifeboats. He said there's also a possibility the boat suffered a catastrophic failure and sank before anybody had time to react.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A wooden schooner built in 1928, the Nina, left port in northern New Zealand at the end of May and dropped out of communication a week later, a maritime safety authority said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was en route to Newcastle, Australia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sailing yacht is equipped with a tracking device, a satellite phone and an emergency buoy, but none of them have been heard from since early June, according to Maritime New Zealand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time of its last sign of life, the Nina was nearly 400 miles northwest of New Zealand in the Tasman Sea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Family members alerted maritime authorities in New Zealand in mid-June that the sailboat may be missing. Rescuers issued alerts to vessels in the area. None reported having seen the Nina. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two extensive sweeps by a reconnaissance plane came up empty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Nina was carrying one British passenger along with the six Americans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shipwreck survivor recounts drama on high seas NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wisdom from the sea: 'React fast or be swept away'","Six Americans and a Brit have vanished without a trace on the high seas between New Zealand and Australia, aboard the 70-foot vessel the Nina, CNN reports.The crew was last heard from on June 4 while battling rough conditions—68mph gusts and waves as high as 26 feet—about a week after their historic schooner left New Zealand's Bay of Islands. Friends reported the vessel missing on June 14, and the fact that its emergency beacon was never activated gave rescuers hope. But the picture that's forming of the Nina's last known movements sounds less promising. A woman aboard the 85-year-old vessel called a New Zealand meteorologist via satellite phone on June 3, asking him, ""The weather's turned nasty, how do we get away from it?"" They spoke briefly, with Bob McDavitt advising the group to sail south. The following day he received the following text: ""ANY UPDATE 4 NINA? ... EVI."" After that, the boat vanished, with two aerial searches turning up nothing. More foreboding details, per the AP: The rescue coordinator says the boat realistically should have arrived in Australia two days ago, and the Nina dealt with some leaking issues earlier this year after a new engine was installed. He expressed ""grave concerns"" to the Age."

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ceglia has pleaded not guilty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The request also comes as a motion by Facebook seeking to have Ceglia's lawsuit thrown out is pending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boland has not publicly said why he wants to withdraw, only that it has nothing to do with any belief that Ceglia engaged in fraud. He submitted his detailed reasons privately to the judge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorneys for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook have asked the judge to make the reasons public, or at least disclose the reasons to them. Facebook won't oppose Boland's motion as long as it does not delay the case, the attorneys said in court filings.

Spanier made $2.9 million in the 2011-2012 fiscal year; part of that was his $1.2 million severance pay, the New York Times reports. ""The fact that Graham Spanier turns out to be the highest paid president in the country says something about the nature of compensation packages for people who leave under a cloud,"" says a reporter for the Chronicle of Higher Education, which conducted the study. Meanwhile, Jay Gogue, at Auburn University, saw compensation of $2.54 million. Ohio State's Gordon Gee earned $1.9 million—along with his rent-free mansion and private jet. George Mason's Alan Merten received $1.87 million. Compensation has soared in recent years, says the Chronicle reporter; Gogue's pay, for instance, jumped from $700,000 to $2.5 million in a year. And 28 presidents were making between $600,000 and $700,000 last year, compared to 13 the prior year. Median compensation among public research university presidents was $441,392."

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let’s start with the time signature. A brisk 3/4, with a crotchet roughly equalling 108 a minute, suggests activity. Positivity, even. But 3/4 is not the most immediately stable of signatures. It’s easy to feel secure in 3/4, but for just a couple of bars it’s disconcerting - especially when starting with an anacrusis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What does Theresa May's taste in music say about her? > NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harmonically, too, it’s ambivalent, confusing. It’s almost fanfare-like in that confident leap of a fourth from G to C, but it quickly loses confidence when it mirrors the ascent later in the bar, plummeting down to D sharp, forming an awkward implied triad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then the percussive spoken ‘Right’, which lands almost perfectly on the first beat of the next bar, is a strange dip into acted-out recitative - demonstrative of a reasonable knowledge of contemporary composition techniques. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is a theory that the soon-to-be-former PM is actually humming the opening of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony – of which more here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conclusion NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, Wagnerian fanfare, Beethoven-esque harmonic doubt and then a strange contemporary flourish at the end. Does this composition demonstrate the unresolved nature of Cameron’s swift departure from office? Is it perhaps a comment on what might be next for 10 Downing Street? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other interpretations on this new and invigorating work are welcome. We’re thinking a new fugue arrangement, a cappella choral version, maybe a theme and variations…","They're calling it ""Cameron's Lament""—though some say it was actually a happy tune from a relieved man. British Prime Minister David Cameron announced on Monday that he will resign on Wednesday afternoon, and a hot mic caught him singing a few notes to himself as he walked the few steps back to his No. 10 Downing Street residence after speaking to the press, CNN reports. He can be heard saying ""Right"" as he steps inside and removes the microphone. Some have said the tune sounded like the start of the West Wing theme, while others believe it sounded more like a Winnie the Pooh-style song, the Guardian reports. After a detailed musical analysis, Classic FM concluded that Cameron's musical notes suggested ""Wagnerian fanfare, Beethoven-esque harmonic doubt, and then a strange contemporary flourish at the end,"" a composition that might demonstrate the ""unresolved nature of Cameron's swift departure from office."" The prime minister is expected to offer his resignation to the queen on Wednesday. He will be replaced by Theresa May, who prevailed in the Conservative Party's post-Brexit leadership race after all of her opponents dropped out. (Some ill-judged comments about motherhood may have hastened the departure of May's last remaining rival.)"

"LEAVENWORTH, Kan. - When US Marshals approached James Robert Jones on a South Florida street Thursday morning, the man convicted of murdering a fellow Army private 40 years ago did not try to fight or flee, but surrendered peacefully, and will soon return to a maximum security prison here, 37 years after he escaped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I knew it would catch up to me one day,"" Jones reportedly told law enforcement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former Army private was convicted of murder in 1974, while stationed at New Jersey's Ft. Dix, and ordered to carry out his 23 year sentence at the US Disciplinary Barracks on Ft. Leavenworth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1977 Jones escaped from the facility, the US Military's only maximum security prison, where imposing walls and towers earned it the nickname the ""Castle."" He spent the next 37 years on the lam. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barry Golden, a senior inspector with the US Marshals Service in Miami, which coordinated the investigation that led to Jones arrest, described his initial escape nearly four decades ago as ""very elaborate."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January, Army investigators, believing Jones to now be living in Florida, contacted Golden's office for assistance. Marshals ran a prison photo of Jones through a database, and it matched closely with the photo on a Florida driver’s license first issued in 1981. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marshals began observing the man they thought to be Jones, now living under the false name Bruce Keith, and on Thursday morning, arrested him outside his work location in nearby Pompano Beach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Golden, Jones had been living a complete new life in Florida. He had ""significant others,"" Golden told 41 Action News, declining to go into detail, and told investigators he was only one year from retirement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jones will soon be extradited back to Kansas to resume his sentence, Golden said, and will likely far additional charges related to his escape.  DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Marshals Service reports that 59-year-old James Robert Jones was arrested Thursday morning when he showed up for work in Pompano Beach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jones had been listed as one of the U.S. Army's 15 Most Wanted for escaping from a federal prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kan., in 1977. As a private in 1974, Jones was sentenced to 23 years in prison for premeditated murder and aggravated assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say Jones obtained a fraudulent Florida driver's license in 1981 and used the name Bruce Walter Keith. He had been living at a home in Deerfield Beach since at least 2005. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January, the Army requested assistance from the U.S. Marshals Service in finding Jones.","A convicted murderer who escaped prison and made a new life for himself in Florida is back in custody after 37 years, reports AP.

Three years later, he busted out and landed in Florida, where he assumed a new identity as Bruce Keith, authorities say. He had been on the Army's ""15 Most Wanted"" list. Jones' life on the lam began unraveling when US marshals, acting on a tip from Army investigators, used a photo database to find a match between his prison photo and one on a bogus Florida driver's license issued in 1981, reports KSHB. That led to surveillance of ""Keith"" and his uneventful arrest yesterday in Pompano Beach. ""I knew it would catch up to me one day,"" he reportedly told the arresting officers.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A new study by University of Chicago Booth School of Business Professor Nicholas Epley and Ph.D. candidate Juliana Schroeder found that when hypothetical employers and professional recruiters listened to or read job candidates' job qualifications, they rated the candidates as more competent, thoughtful and intelligent when they heard the pitch than when they read it—even when the words used were exactly the same. As a result, they liked the candidate more and were more interested in hiring them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the addition of video did not influence evaluations beyond hearing the candidate's voice, the researchers note. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""In addition to communicating the contents of one's mind, like specific thoughts and beliefs, a person's speech conveys their fundamental capacity to think—the capacity for reasoning, thoughtfulness and intellect,"" says Epley. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Titled ""The Sound of Intellect: Speech Reveals a Thoughtful Mind, Increasing a Job Candidate's Appeal,"" the study will be published in an upcoming issue of The Journal of Psychological Science, the highest ranked empirical journal in the field of psychology. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a series of experiments, the researchers asked a group of Chicago Booth MBA student job candidates to develop a short pitch to the company for which they would most like to work. They created written pitches and spoken pitches (videotaped). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an initial experiment, a separate group of evaluators judged the spoken pitches by either watching and listening to the video recording, listening to the audio only, or reading a transcript of the pitch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The evaluators who heard the pitch subsequently rated the candidate as more intelligent, thoughtful and competent than the evaluators who only read a transcript of the pitch; the evaluators who watched the video pitch did not rate any differently than those who heard the pitch. In fact, evaluators who heard the pitch reported liking the candidate more and reported being significantly more likely to hire that person. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another experiment, the evaluators who listened to trained actors reading job candidates' written pitches out loud believed those candidates were more intelligent and wanted to hire them more than the evaluators who read candidates' own written pitches. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even professional recruiters (who recruit candidates from Chicago Booth) were more likely to hire the candidates whose pitches they could hear than those whose pitches they read. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Epley concludes: ""When conveying intelligence, it's important for one's voice to be heard—literally."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Explore further: Employers often more interested in hiring potential playmates than the very best candidates","If you're trying to land a job, it's much better to explain why you're the perfect candidate in person than in an email, a new study suggests. And it's got nothing to do with power suits—it's all about your voice. Employers are more likely to rate people as intelligent if they hear their pitch than if they read it, say researchers at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In their experiments, the researchers had students prepare videotaped pitches for their dream companies. Evaluators rated the applicants more highly if they listened to the audio rather than reading the same words in a transcript, the researchers write at phys.org. Watching the video didn't seem to affect the scores at all. ""In addition to communicating the contents of one's mind, like specific thoughts and beliefs, a person's speech conveys their fundamental capacity to think—the capacity for reasoning, thoughtfulness and intellect,"" says lead researcher Nicholas Epley. In the tests, ""intellect was conveyed primarily through voice,"" perhaps through subtle variances in pitch and cadence, writes Wray Herbert at the Huffington Post. He thinks it backs up that age-old advice about the importance of wrangling face time with a potential boss. Or as a post at Counsel & Heal puts it, ""work on your voice to get your dream job."" (In other voice research, a study finds that lousy singers can improve—by singing more.)"
"Fred Beckey, a fabled mountaineer and author who was the first to take hundreds of routes to the summits of North America’s tallest peaks in Alaska, the Canadian Rockies and the Pacific Northwest in an audacious seven-decade climbing career, died on Monday in Seattle.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SEATTLE (AP) — Legendary mountain climber Fred Beckey, who wrote dozens of books and is credited with notching more first ascents than any other American mountaineer, has died. He was 94. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Megan Bond, a close friend who managed his affairs, told The Associated Press that Beckey died of natural causes in her Seattle home Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""He was an extraordinary mountaineer. He also had a personality and humor that almost dwarfed the mountains around him,"" Bond said. ""He was a brilliant writer. He was a scholar. He lived based on what was important to him, and he was not going to sell out."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beckey was known as much for his eccentric personality as for his singular obsession with climbing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was born in Germany and immigrated to the United States as a child. His family settled in Seattle, where he got his first taste of hiking and scrambling with the Boy Scouts and later The Mountaineers club. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1942, he and his younger brother Helmut wowed the climbing community with an impressive second ascent of Mount Waddington in British Columbia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He went on to accomplish hundreds of first ascents on peaks throughout the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, Canada and Wyoming. In 1954, he established new routes on three of Alaska's mountains: McKinley, Deborah and Hunter. He also climbed in the Himalayas and China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Fred got the golden age of climbing first ascents,"" Alex Bertulis, a former climbing partner told the AP last year. ""That will be his legacy."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He authored more than a dozen books, including the three-volume ""Cascade Alpine Guide"" that details hundreds of peaks in the North Cascades in Washington state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beckey once wrote that climbing gave him a unique sense of control over his destiny. ""The exaltation one can get in the presence of mountains can be a memorable lesson in humility and an aid to self-realization,"" he wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Fred was a true American icon. His legacy is profound, and he has inspired countless people to explore this amazing planet,"" Dave O'Leske said in a statement. He directed the documentary feature film, ""Dirtbag: The Legend of Fred Beckey"" and spent the past decade filming Beckey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even in his 90s, Beckey was still plotting routes and climbing — though more slowly and with the help of a cadre of fiercely protective partners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bond said they were planning a trip to the Himalayas next spring and she was working on arranging porters to carry him. In recent weeks, she and others took him climbing to Squamish, British Columbia. It was logistically complicated, she said, but he was able to get about half a pitch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Beckey, she said, ""there was always more to do."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beckey is survived by his younger brother Helmut.

"More wine is drunk per person in the Vatican City than in any other country in the world, according to the latest statistics released by the Wine Institute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The figures show that residents of the Vatican consume 74 litres of wine on average – roughly equivalent to 105 bottles over the course of a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s around double the amount drunk by the average person in France or Italy as a whole, and triple the quantity consumed in the UK. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no denying that the population of the Vatican represents an unusual, and rather uniform, demographic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As well as the occupational hazard of being required to take ceremonial Communion wine, the National Catholic Reporter said Vatican residents are more likely to be old, male, highly educated and eat in larger groups – all factors that can contribute to greater wine consumption. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These aspects of the Vatican’s national character are more likely to put it at the top than simply its size alone – though other so-called microstates also featured prominently in the Wine Institute’s list. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fact that it only has a population of around 800 people does make it easy for per-capita figures to be distorted by outlying groups, however – and in the Vatican there is reportedly a single supermarket supplying everyone with wine almost completely tax-free.  The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public.","If you're a big fan of wine and would like to be surrounded by apparently like-minded people, consider moving to Vatican City. Despite its small size, or perhaps because of it, it manages to consume more wine per capita than any other country, according to the Wine Institute. How much exactly? At 74 liters of wine per person, double Italy's consumption, Religion News Service reports—and in terms of major countries, Italy is one of the top two wine consumers. That amount translates to about 105 bottles of wine per resident per year, the Independent notes. And no, this doesn't hinge around all that communion wine. As local media have pointed out, the number is probably so high because Vatican residents are, in general, older, male, and highly educated, and they eat communal meals. All of those factors tend to increase wine consumption. And with a population of just 800, those numbers are easily skewed by outliers. Oh yeah, and then there's the fact that just one store sells wine in the Vatican—and the wine is practically tax-free."
"At least two open investigations into... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR COLUMBIA, Mo. - University of Missouri officials have at least two open investigations into the potential use of ""date rape"" drugs at Delta Upsilon fraternity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ABC 17 News first reported Wednesday through an open records request the series of incidents that led to a temporary suspension of Delta Upsilon in late September. The fraternity was given disciplinary probation just a day before a racially-charged incident with students in the Legion of Black Collegians ended up in DU front lawn on September 27. The national organization placed its Columbia chapter on emergency suspension the next day, and the school's Office of Student Conduct continues to investigate that issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DU received probation after several issues arose from parties on August 27 and September 10. A 20-year-old woman was taken by ambulance for an alcohol overdose, a man was pushed down a flight of steps during a fight and an 18-year-old girl tripped and hit her head after drinking too much at DU during the September incident. The fraternity had been given two warnings prior to that by the school for underage drinking and ""failing to comply"" with University police during a theft investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ABC 17 News uncovered a letter from the Title IX Office informing the fraternity of a possible investigation into use of ""date rape"" drugs. The letter, dated September 13, said the office received numerous contacts from students, along with social media posts that claim ""active members of Delta Upsilon fraternity allegedly provided each new member with three pills and instructed them to drug women for the purpose of incapacitating them prior to engaging in sexual activity."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter from Title IX Administrator Ellen Eardley goes on to say, ""Should my office receive any information indicating that there is any veracity to the allegations that Delta Upsilon promoted sexual misconduct and hazing, an investigation will begin immediately."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MU spokesman Christian Basi told ABC 17 News Thursday he could not comment on the status of that particular matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An MUPD police report details a medical call on Sept. 16 for an 18-year-old student acting strangely in Johnston Hall. The woman was naked from the waist down, the officer wrote, and had ""smeared feces"" on the walls of the hall. She eventually went to the hospital with a friend and the police, telling them she had been drinking at several places, including DU. She did not see how made her drinks at that fraternity, according to the report. At University Hospital, officers took samples of her urine to test for drug intoxication that night. She also told officers she did not remember whether or not she had sex that night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officer Bryanne Gawlik also wrote that the woman did not see who made her drinks that day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Major Brian Weimer confirmed that investigation is still open. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ashley Martin, DU national director of communications, told ABC 17 News the fraternity has ""worked tirelessly and collaboratively"" with the school to investigate these reports, some of which they had just learned about. Martin pointed to an ""internal membership review"" at Mizzou two years ago that led to the removal of 90 of its 123 members.They also reorganized chapter policy, including alcohol and guest rules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We will not condone or tolerate the type of behavior alleged in these incidents, and the chapter remains on a temporary suspension as our investigation continues,"" Martin said in an email. ""We are committed to holding all members to our code of conduct, and our investigation will help us determine whether our Missouri Chapter can positively contribute to a safe, enriching and inclusive campus environment."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While individual students could face expulsion for any violations of student conduct, Basi said the fraternity as a whole could see ""withdrawal of recognition"" by the university. That means the fraternity could not use school spaces for anything, and it would be unable to participate in events like Homecoming. A group that receives such a punishment could either appeal, or reapply for recognition, depending on the punishment laid out by the Office of Student Conduct.

According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, multiple people informed the school in August that members of Delta Upsilon had given new members three pills each and told them to drug woman and have sex with them as the final step of initiation. Justin Kirk, executive director of Delta Upsilon, calls the allegations ""deeply concerning"" but notes there have been no claims of sexual assault brought against the frat. But in September, an 18-year-old girl was hospitalized after being possibly drugged, ABC 17 reports. She was found naked from the waist down and smearing feces on a wall after drinking at Delta Upsilon. She didn't see who was making her drinks and didn't remember if she had sex that night. This is just one in a string of problems at Delta Upsilon—which was temporarily suspended last month by both its national organization and the University of Missouri—including underage drinking, physical abuse, at least one assault, and a ""racial incident."" In September, frat members reportedly yelled racist and sexist slurs at black female students. Members also reportedly forced drunk pledges to fight each other. In one incident of underage drinking last year at Delta Upsilon, a woman had to be hospitalized. In 2014, the frat removed 90 of its 132 members and hired a live-in graduate student as well as an off-duty police officer to keep an eye on things. Multiple school investigations into Delta Upsilon are ongoing."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Police are still looking for a suspect in Friday night's shooting near the White House and Washington Monument and say they haven't found any bullets in buildings, cars or trees to indicate what the shooter might have been aiming at. No one was injured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Park Police have an arrest warrant out for Oscar Ramiro Ortega on a felony charge of carrying a dangerous weapon, and they would like Ortega to come forward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We want to hear from Mr. Ortega,"" said Park Police Sgt. David Schlosser."" We want to hear his version as to what happened. This will help us fill in the blanks as to what actually occurred on Friday evening and we'd like to resolve this soon."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses -- including uniformed Secret Service officers -- heard shots fired Friday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schlosser said he didn't know if Ortega had a history of anti-government activity or rhetoric and also did not know if he is a U.S. citizen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police found a crashed car near Theodore Roosevelt Bridge and say Ortega had been driving it. Schlosser said investigators found a semi-automatic weapon and shell casings inside the vehicle. That bridge is west of the White House and Washington Monument and is a major route into Virginia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The actions that Mr. Ortega participated on Friday evening -- that being the discharge of a firearm near the White House -- is an inherently dangerous activity, and because of that we do want to find Mr. Ortega as quickly as possible,"" said Schlosser. ""At this point we're not certain what his intentions were."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the same day the shooting incident happened, Ortega was stopped by police in Virginia around 11 a.m. for some sort of suspicious activity, said Lt. Joe Kantor with Arlington County Police. Kantor did not provide details on what behavior Ortega allegedly had been engaged in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ortega was not arrested in that stop, but Arlington County police took photos of him including one showing one of his tattoos spelling out the word ""Israel"" on his neck. U.S. Park Police later used those pictures in their releases asking the public for any information on the shooting incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ortega is described as a Hispanic male, 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighing about 160 pounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the U.S. Park Police, the 21-year old Ortega has a history of criminal activity in three states that includes drug charges, underage possession of alcohol and assaults on law enforcement officers. Schlosser said the charges occurred in Idaho where Ortega was known to have lived, as well as in Texas and Utah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schlosser said law enforcement officials believe Ortega has been in the Washington area for several weeks.  ABC News has learned authorities are increasingly concerned that a man sought in connection with a bizarre shooting incident on the Washington Mall last week may pose a threat to President Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Secret Service now suspects that a bullet fired in this incident may have hit the White House after a bullet round was found in a White House window, though the round had not yet been conclusively linked to the incident. The round was stopped by ballistic glass behind the historic exterior glass, while an additional round has been found on the exterior of the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police believe the suspect, 21-year-old Oscar Ramiro Ortega of Idaho, is mentally ill. Ortega has an extensive record, ranging from domestic violence to drug charges. Sources say a police investigation has uncovered evidence suggesting Ortega has a fixation on the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At 9:30 p.m. Friday, police received reports of shots fired in the bustling area of 16th street and Constitution Ave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities would later find a car in the area. The suspect had fled, but what police discovered inside the vehicle left them deeply concerned: an assault style rifle and empty shell casings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police linked the car to Ortega and have been hunting him ever since. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s unclear whether Ortega is capable of launching a sophisticated attack, but police are still fearful of what he might do next. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities suspect Ortega has been in the area for weeks, coming back and forth to the Washington Mall. Before the shooting, he was detained by local police at an abandoned house. U.S. Park police say Ortega may have spent time blending in with Occupy D.C. protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Obama, who is currently on a visit to Australia, was not present at the White House at the time of the incident, and in fact has been out of town for the past week. Secret Service officials are not taking any chances with the security of the President and the White House, though, and want Ortega off the street.","A suspect believed to have fired shots at the White House last week is still at large and police believe he may be a threat to President Obama. A semi-automatic weapon was found in a crashed car belonging to Oscar Ramiro Ortega, a 21-year-old Idaho man, CNN reports. Ortega has a fixation with the White House and a criminal record that includes convictions for domestic violence, drug offenses, and assaulting police officers, sources tell ABC. A bullet was found in a White House window after Friday's incident. It had been stopped by ballistic glass behind the historic exterior glass. Authorities believe Ortega has been in the DC area for weeks, repeatedly visiting the Washington Mall, and possibly blending in with Occupy protesters."

Photo: Emoji Fame  A Texas House representative from Cypress has introduced a resolution urging Texans to quit using the Chilean flag emoji as a stand-in for the Lone Star. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR HCR 75, filed Thursday, urges ""Texans not to use the flag emoji of the Republic of Chile when referring to the Texas flag.""  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.The goal is to fix all broken links on the web . Crawls of supported ""No More 404"" sites.","The Chilean flag is annoyingly similar to Texas' state flag, but that doesn't mean Lone Star Staters should appropriate Chile's flag emoji when they feel like expressing Texas pride. That's the gist of what one state lawmaker is trying to push through via Texas House Concurrent Resolution 75, which takes it upon itself to ""urge"" residents not to use the Chilean icon online as a substitute for the non-existent Texas flag emoji, the Houston Chronicle reports. In what the Dallas Morning News says belongs under the ""yes, it's a real bill"" umbrella, Cypress' conservative Rep. Tom Oliverson filed the resolution, noting, ""Just as our flag could never fully embody the country of Chile, neither can the Chilean flag inspire feelings of pride and passion in the heart of a true Texan."" He points out that although both flags feature a similar red, white, and blue layout capped by that lone star, which often causes emoji-users to confuse Chile's flag for Texas' flag, Chile's colors are meant to symbolize ""sky, snow, and blood spilled while fighting for freedom,"" while Texas' hues are meant to represent ""loyalty, purity, and bravery."" He also notes that the blue in his state's flag extends all the way down to the bottom, while Chile's is cut off into a square about halfway down (he even wants to get the #TheBlueGoesAllTheWayDown hashtag to pick up steam). That said, Oliverson concedes this bill isn't ""the most pressing issue"" the Legislature has on its plate at the moment, per the Morning News. (The White House rejected a Texas secession petition a few years back.)"

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But 2018 was the first time in eight years that not a single woman has been included on the list — not even Serena Williams, one of the most accomplished and well-known athletes in history. She, along with fellow tennis players Maria Sharapova and Li Na, have made the list in recent years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Forbes, Williams most likely lost her spot on the list because she had a baby last year, and therefore was unable to earn as much prize money as she has in years past. She was the top-earning female athlete in 2018 at $18 million, but fell nearly $5 million short of the $22.9 million cutoff for the top 100. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pay gap in sports has been an especially pressing issue in recent years, as several women’s teams have initiated campaigns advocating for gender pay equity. The U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team has largely led the charge on this front, succeeding in securing a new collective bargaining agreement in 2017 after a year of arguing its case publicly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women had argued that players for the men’s national team earned far more than they did despite comparable work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Around the same time, the U.S. Women’s National Hockey Team also reached an agreement with USA Hockey to end a wage dispute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, seeing as no women were able to clear the bar to make the Forbes top 100 list this year, the problem is clearly nowhere near solved, female athletes said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former soccer star Abby Wambach has devoted her retirement to advocating for equal pay in sports. In a recent speech at the Barnard College commencement, she noted that she and her male peers had “left it all on the field for decades with the same ferocity, talent and commitment."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""But our retirements wouldn’t be the same at all,"" she said. Referring to basketball star Kobe Bryant and quarterback Peyton Manning, she noted, ""Kobe and Peyton walked away from their careers with something I didn’t have: enormous bank accounts.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several current and former athletes shared the lopsided statistics on social media. Tennis legend Billie Jean King, who broke barriers by pushing for equal prize money for women, said in a Twitter post: ""Men, we need you to advocate as much for women as you do for other men. When more men in power become allies and care about gender equality, the power differential will shift."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sports are a microcosm of society. Men, we need you to advocate as much for women as you do for other men. When more men in power become allies and care about gender equality, the power differential will shift. #HeForShe #EqualityForAll https://t.co/uaLVqJUDKQ — Billie Jean King (@BillieJeanKing) June 6, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is very sad.... and ppl say we are winning the war on equality, opportunity, and there is no such thing as a pay gap. https://t.co/BEdHUNqnTq — Kaillie Humphries (@BobsledKaillie) June 7, 2018 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Canadian bobsledder Kaillie Humphries, an Olympic champion in 2010 and 2014, told NBC News that the lack of women on the Forbes list was frustrating. “There’s plenty of strong, powerful females that exist within our society that are high performance and demand excellence for themselves and what they do,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humphries also said many of her male peers believe that the striking inequities in bobsleigh and other sports are acceptable, but that all athletes — not just female athletes — will need to recognize the pay gap as a problem going forward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think talking about it is the first step. I think we were able to get to this position because of the females before us. You look at Billie Jean King. We were able to ride that wave for so long, and now we’re kind of at a standstill, and the conversation has stopped,” she said. “Hopefully [gender inequity] can become a global conversation so we can hold people accountable, and we can create change.”","Women in sports say Forbes' annual list of the world's highest-paid athletes is proof that the gender pay gap is real and pressing. That's because—for the first time in eight years—not a single woman made the cut. The highest-paid female athlete in 2017—the year she gave birth to a daughter—was Serena Williams. Her $18 million puts her roughly $5 million below the take of the man to hold the 100th spot, Nicolas Batum of the Charlotte Hornets, who made $22.9 million, reports NBC News.

"Breast implants may cause a small but significant increase in the risk of an extremely rare but treatable type of cancer , the Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The risk applies to both saline- and silicone-filled implants, and to all women who have them, whether for reconstruction after cancer surgery or for cosmetic enlargement of the breasts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cancer, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, involves the immune system. It is not breast cancer. It is usually a systemic disease, but in the cases linked to implants, the lymphoma grew in the breast, usually in the capsule of scar tissue that formed around the implant. The cases were discovered because women developed symptoms long after they had healed from the implant surgery — lumps, pain, asymmetry of the breasts, fluid buildup and swelling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some cases simply removing the implant and scar tissue gets rid of the disease, but some women might need chemotherapy and radiation, said Dr. William Maisel, the chief scientist and deputy director for science in the drug agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. He said there was some evidence, though not conclusive, that the form of this lymphoma found in implant patients was less aggressive than the usual type. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, the drug agency said it knew of about 60 cases worldwide, a tiny number compared with the 5 million to 10 million women who have implants. But even that small number appears to be an excess of cases when compared with the usual incidence of the disease: This type of lymphoma in the breast is normally found in only 3 in 100 million women who do not have implants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the risk appears to be so small, the drug agency said, “the existing data support the continued marketing and use of breast implants.” But it also said that women considering implants should first discuss the information with their doctors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Women with implants who have no symptoms do not need to do anything special or change their routine health care, Dr. Maisel said. But they should pay attention to any changes and see a doctor if swelling, lumps or other symptoms develop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because there is very little data on the lymphoma, Dr. Maisel said, the agency “is not comfortable recommending a specific treatment.” Cases may differ, and women who have the disease need to be treated by a breast surgeon and an oncologist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The worldwide market for breast implants is roughly $820 million a year and growing at 8 percent a year, according to industry figures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Food and Drug Administration said it needed more data and was asking doctors to report confirmed cases to its safety information program, MedWatch. Dr. Maisel said the agency was working with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons to create a registry of cases. He also said that information about the possible link to the cancer would be added to the labeling information sent out with implants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Maisel said it was not yet known for sure whether the implants really increase the risk of the cancer, or how they could do so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We do know that both silicone and saline implants are surrounded by silicone,” he said, adding that silicone has been found in cells around breast implants and may stimulate the cells and induce lymphoma in rare cases. But he added, “Please understand that is speculative and a hypothesis.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokeswoman for Allergan, which makes implants, sent a statement by e-mail saying that the company supported the drug agency’s recommendations. But the statement also said: “Reports of ALCL in patients with breast implants are extremely rare and are not to be mistaken for breast cancer. A woman is more likely to be struck by lightning than get this condition.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another implant maker, Mentor, did not respond to a telephone message asking for comment on the drug agency announcement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A medical group, the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, issued a statement saying it supported the development of a registry for the cancer cases in women with implants, but added that implants were “the most studied device in medical history” and were safe.  The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing a possible link between breast implants and a form of cancer.The federal agency said on Wednesday that 13 years of research citing 34 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in breast implant patients has shown that individuals who undergo the procedure ""may have a very small but increased risk of developing"" the disease.""But with an estimated 5 to 10 million breast implant recipients worldwide, agency experts say the known ALCL cases are too few to say conclusively that breast implants cause the disease,"" the statement added Surge Desk offers a quick list of three other common hazards associated with breast implants.Breast augmentation surgery holds the same risks of most other common operations, including seroma and hematoma (fluid and blood build-up). Adverse reaction to anesthesia is a rare occurrence but also a common concern.Ruptured implants are one of the most common health hazards associated with breast augmentation due to the likelihood of leaking silicone, therefore most experts conclude that implants in such cases should be removed as soon as possible. The FDA explains that ""capsular contracture occurs when the scar tissue or capsule that normally forms around the implant tightens and squeezes the implant."" The condition commonly requires re-operation and, along with ruptured implants, is one of the most common concerns associated with silicone-gel-filled and saline-filled breast implants.","Breast implants have been linked to an extremely rare but treatable cancer, the New York Times reports. It's called anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and in these cases, it usually forms in the scar tissue around the implant. The link was seen in saline and silicone implants, and in both reconstructive implants for breast cancer sufferers and in cosmetic surgeries. The good news: Only about 60 cases have been reported worldwide—out of 5 million to 10 million women with implants. Given the rarity of the condition, the FDA said implants are still safe, though women considering them should factor it into their decision. One manufacturer of implants said ""a woman is more likely to be struck by lightning than get this condition.” Most women diagnosed reported symptoms—including lumps, fluid buildup, pain, and swelling—long after they had healed from surgery.

Police Chief David Brown said the man identified himself as James Boulware and blamed police for ""accusing him of being a terrorist"" and causing him to lose custody of his son. He allegedly opened fire on police headquarters with automatic weapons about 12:30am and left two explosive devices near the building.

"The actress “didn’t believe this day would come,” she said on “Megyn Kelly Today” Friday, reacting to the early morning arrest of Harvey Weinstein, whom she says raped her 20 years ago at the Sundance Film Festival. Her reaction was right in line with how much of Hollywood cheered the mogul’s downfall.  On Thursday, Morgan Freeman issued a statement of apology following accusations of harassment by multiple women who have worked on movie sets with him, worked for his production company, or interviewed him in a professional setting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a CNN report published on Thursday, eight women alleged that the 80-year-old actor subjected them to inappropriate behavior, including unwanted touching and comments about their figure. Several of the accusers said they didn't report Freeman's alleged behavior because they feared for their jobs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Freeman responded to the accusations in a statement to ET. ""Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy,"" the statement reads. ""I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected -- that was never my intent."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, interview footage from past ET sit-downs with the Oscar-nominated actor shows more examples of questionable behavior, as described in the CNN report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, author and activist Janet Mock served as an ET special correspondent covering Freeman’s film, Five Flights Up. During their junket interview, Freeman addressed Mock’s appearance, saying, “I don’t know how you all manage to do that all the time.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You got a dress halfway between your knee and your hips, and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs,” he continued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mock, who is currently writing and producing for Ryan Murphy’s new FX series, Pose, addressed the encounter in a statement to ET on Thursday, saying, “This interaction is an exhibition of the casual nature at which men in positions of power believe that everything belongs to them, including women’s bodies as they’re merely just trying to do their job.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “For me, as a young woman of color, who is a reporter and a fan of popular culture, I was deeply disappointed that someone who was seen as America’s grandfather was susceptible to such disturbing behavior and felt comfortable enough to do that as cameras were rolling, and that he could take claim of my body and look at it before even looking into my eyes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Entertainment reporter Chloe Melas, who co-authored the CNN piece on the accusations against Freeman, said she began reaching out to women after experiencing what she described as her own inappropriate encounter with the actor, at a press junket for his 2017 film, Going in Style. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melas, who was six months pregnant at the time, claims Freeman looked her up and down while shaking her hand, and repeatedly said some variation of “I wish I was there,” as cameras rolled in front of his co-stars and other junket personnel. The reporter said she was later told that Warner Bros. HR could not corroborate the account because only one of Freeman's remarks was on video and the Warner Bros. employees present did not notice anything.

On Friday, the 80-year-old actor issued a personal defense of his behavior with women, saying he's kidded around with female colleagues but never jeopardized work environments or offered jobs for sex, the LA Times reports. ""I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports,"" Freeman says in a statement. ""All victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard. And we need to listen to them. But it is not right to equate horrific incidents of sexual assault with misplaced compliments or humor."" Freeman is likely referring to recent Entertainment Tonight footage of him sitting down with female interviewers. In one instance, he asks a correspondent if she was married and ""fooled around with other guys."" In another, with author/activist Janet Mock, he marvels at how she ""got a dress halfway between your knee and your hips, and ... cross[ed] your legs."" For Mock, this was ""an exhibition of the casual nature at which men in positions of power believe that everything belongs to them, including women's bodies."" But Freeman says he only wanted women to ""feel appreciated and at ease around me. As a part of that, I would often try to joke with and compliment women, in what I thought was a lighthearted and humorous way."" See his initial apology here."
"ABC News' Sheila Marikar ( @ SheilaYM ) reports: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps this week's lesson in the annals of American history was necessary for Sarah Palin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Boston yesterday, visiting Paul Revere's house, she offered her own account of the Revolutionairy War hero's midnight ride from Boston to Lexington, Mass.: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""He who warned, uh, the ... the British that they weren't gonna be taking away our arms, uh, by ringing those bells and, um, by making sure that as he's riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that, uh, we were gonna be secure and we were gonna be free ... and we were gonna be armed."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, Revere was in fact trying to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams about the approaching British army. And he didn't rely on bells. He was on a covert mission. Had he used bells, or had he warned the people with whom America was at war, Palin's tour bus might have chugged through the northeast on the left side of the road.  america's sweetheart Sarah Palin Reveals Fascinating New Account of Paul Revere’s Midnight Ride NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Americans think they have a solid understanding of the country's founding. No taxation without representation, tea party, Boston Massacre, George Washington, all that jazz. But, not surprisingly, Über-patriot Sarah Palin knows more than the average American. In fact, she may have more expertise on the subject than anybody else. For example, yesterday she revealed some heretofore unknown facts about Paul Revere's midnight ride. Did you know that he was actually warning the British, through the repeated ringin' of bells? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The transcript: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He who warned, uh, the the British that they weren’t gonna be takin’ away our arms, uh, by ringin’ those bells and, um, by makin’ sure that as he’s ridin’ his horse through town to send those warnin’ shots and bells that, uh, we were gonna be secure and we were gonna be free and we were gonna be armed.","Lately, it seems that the history of the American Revolution is not the strong suit of the two most well-known Republican women who could decide to run for president. Back in March, Michele Bachmann stated that ""the shot heard 'round the world"" at Lexington and Concord was fired in New Hampshire. Then yesterday Sarah Palin made a history error of her own: Stopping in Boston on her bus tour, she stated that Paul Revere warned the British about the American arms locations. ABC News has her comment: ""He who warned, uh, the ... the British that they weren't gonna be taking away our arms, uh, by ringing those bells and, um, by making sure that as he's riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that, uh, we were gonna be secure and we were gonna be free ... and we were gonna be armed.""

"In the first of what will be a closely watched selection process for a powerful new deficit panel, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced he will appoint Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington, Max Baucus of Montana and John Kerry of Massachusetts as his three choices for a super committee charged with finding more than $1 trillion in spending cuts by the end of this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murray will serve as co-chairwoman of the 12-member panel. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) will select a member to co-chair the committee and two other panelists, as required by the debt-limit agreement signed into law by President Barack Obama last week. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will each select three additional members.

The super committee was Reid’s contribution to the bipartisan agreement to end the debt-limit fight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior appropriator and Budget Committee member, Murray is also the chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has made the GOP’s focus on overhauling Medicare a centerpiece of the 2012 campaign. Baucus is the chairman of the powerful Finance Committee, while Kerry — the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee — has been lobbying for a spot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the choice of Murray has already spawned anger from Republicans, who called it a blatantly political move aimed at filling coffers for the Democratic campaign committee. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called on Reid to withdraw the appointment immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The select committee is no place for someone whose top priority is fundraising and politics,” Priebus said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reid and Pelosi had been considering whether to install candidates who will draw a hard-line against deep entitlement cuts, particularly if Republicans don’t bend on new taxes. The Democratic leaders want loyalists who won’t give the panel majority support for a cuts-only approach, which could target popular programs like Medicare and Social Security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The No. 1 criteria should be someone who fights for revenues, and if Republicans continue to rule out revenues, then the Democrats have to play proper defense in response,” said a senior Democratic aide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a joint statement, Kerry, Baucus and Murray said they are serious about answering the call to “step beyond partisanship and politics” and achieve a “balanced, pragmatic and practical” solution to the soaring national debt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an email sent to her colleagues Monday evening, Pelosi said her caucus is committed to “protecting” Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security — and said that the new panel should deliberate in public settings so that it achieves a “balanced” approach to deficit reduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Many of you have expressed your interest in serving on the joint committee,” Pelosi told her colleagues. “I have and will be reaching out to each of you before making any decision.”  Web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from March 2011.

"CENTER LOVELL, Maine (AP) — A Virgin Islands couple will be trading the Caribbean breezes of St. John for the rigors of Maine's four seasons after winning a ""Win an Inn"" essay contest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prince and Rose Adams, both 45 and originally from New York City, entered the contest organized by Janice Sage. The retiring owner of the Center Lovell Inn had won the restaurant and hostelry in a similar writing contest 22 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Boston Globe reports (bit.ly/1IQUHLX) that the Adamses were notified last week that they had been picked by a local panel of judges assembled by Sage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They're closing their restaurant in St. John and expect to be open for business in Center Lovell by July 10.  The Maine State Police are investigating whether a Maine woman broke the law in a recent essay contest to give away her 210-year-old inn, Sergeant Michael Johnston of the State Police’s special investigations unit said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Center Lovell Inn and Restaurant, with spectacular views of the White Mountains, was awarded June 6 to a US Virgin Islands couple who ran a Caribbean-style restaurant on St. John. Janice Sage, the Maine innkeeper who held the essay contest, said Prince and Rose Adams were chosen from thousands of entrants who each submitted a 200-word essay and $125 entry fee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, dozens of unsuccessful contestants are crying foul about what they argue, among other concerns, was deceptive advertising. The group has organized as the Center Lovell Contest Fair Practices Commission and complained that Sage incorrectly stated that no advantage would be granted to restaurant or inn owners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “One of the many allegations against Janice Sage and the contest she sponsored is that the advertising of the contest . . . was illegally deceptive and violated consumer-rights regulations, intentionally coercing thousands of people to enter a contest that they never had an actual chance of winning,” said Kelley Prass Collins, who founded the group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In short, Janice Sage was advertising a contest for ‘dreamers’ who would never have the chance to own an inn and restaurant, and then handed the prize to just such a business owner.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neither Sage nor the Adamses could be reached for comment Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maine State Police said their investigation is narrowly tailored to determine whether the contest violated state law on games of skill. Under the law, which is an older statute primarily written to cover carnival games, operators of such games are prohibited from partially or completely controlling the outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Entrants into the Center Lovell Inn contest had been told the winner would be chosen by an independent, local panel of judges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have received some complaints, so we are being responsive to that and are looking into it to determine if any violations of the [state] law occurred,” Johnston said. “We’re not there to determine if other federal laws or rules may have been violated, such as through the Federal Trade Commission, or whether any potential civil liability may exist.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sage said she received fewer than the 7,500 entries she had sought. But at $125 per essay, Sage said, she secured enough money for retirement after running the inn for 22 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sage won the inn in much the same way. After managing a busy Maryland restaurant for years, Sage said, she wanted a change and submitted the winning essay to acquire the sprawling inn and restaurant in a previous contest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnston said the investigation is expected to be completed within a week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The contestants may want to consult a qualified private attorney to determine if there are any other options,” Johnston said.","Maine State Police are investigating whether an innkeeper violated state law in an essay contest with her 210-year-old country inn as the prize. Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said today an investigation was opened into whether the ""Win an Inn"" contest violated laws governing games of chance. The Boston Globe first reported that some contest losers felt the odds were stacked against them, contending that Center Lovell Inn owner Janice Sage marketed the contest to ""dreamers"" but instead awarded the prize to a couple with hospitality business experience in the Virgin Islands. ""One of the many allegations against Janice Sage and the contest she sponsored is that the advertising of the contest ... was illegally deceptive and violated consumer-rights regulations, intentionally coercing thousands of people to enter a contest that they never had an actual chance of winning,"" says the founder of the Center Lovell Contest Fair Practices Commission, a group made up of dozens of unhappy contestants. The entry fee was $125. Sage told the Globe she received fewer than the 7,500 entries she sought, but it was still enough to fund her retirement."
"Salim Saleh's new responsibilities in Lord's Resistance Army are sign Kony is weakening, according to general NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Uganda's notorious rebel chief Joseph Kony has named his son as deputy leader of his Lord's Resistance Army, a guerrilla force infamous for its extreme violence, the country's army has said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Salim Saleh, reported to be 22, is understood to have spent his entire life in the bush with his father's force, which continues to defy international efforts to hunt them down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Previously the son was in charge of the group providing security to the father, but now he has an added responsibility of field command,"" the top Ugandan general Sam Kavuma said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kavuma claimed it was a sign that Kony's control of the force had been weakened, with fighters now split into several autonomous gangs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Long since forced from Uganda, the rebels roam remote forest regions of the Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The role of the son is an indication Kony has lost contact with most of his commanders, some who have been killed by our forces and others are in disarray, with the rebels becoming weaker,"" Kavuma said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the force has shown itself adept at avoiding capture and continues to launch attacks despite being hunted by Ugandan troops with the support of US special forces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kony, who launched a rebellion in Uganda more than two decades ago, is wanted by the international criminal court along with fellow top commanders on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, sexual slavery and using child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Intelligence information collated from [rebel] defectors indicate Kony's son is the most influential person after his father,"" said Kavuma, who heads the Ugandan mission searching for the rebel chief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Salim Saleh is reportedly named after the younger brother of the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, a top military officer and influential politician.  A United Nations official said the activities of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army have been greatly reduced, but that there is ""no room for complacency"" while the group's leader, Joseph Kony, is still operating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abou Moussa, the head of the U.N. Regional Office for Central Africa, told the Security Council on Monday that an African-led military campaign and defections by rebels have weakened the L.R.A. He said the result has been a continued decline in the number of killings, abductions and people forced from their homes by the rebels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Now we need to see our way collectively to make sure that Kony himself is removed from the battlefield so that populations, IDPs, refugees can all go back home and live in peace,"" said Moussa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he thinks Kony's capture is ""coming pretty soon."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A report from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week said there are credible sources suggesting Kony and other senior L.R.A. commanders recently sought a safe haven in an area known as Kafia Kingi that is controlled by Sudan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moussa cautioned that Kony regularly moves around the forested region that straddles the borders of Sudan, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, and that most of the L.R.A. activity is now in the C.A.R. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He may have been sighted, but that doesn’t mean he’s permanent because he knows eyes are after him. We have troops who are tracking him on a daily basis,” said Moussa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moussa also said he met with Sudan's ambassador, who reaffirmed that the Sudanese government is not harboring Kony and that the area is a ""no-man's land."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., called on Sudan to work with the African Union to investigate the reported sighting and not give the LRA any support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Any government should be embarrassed to be sheltering the Lord's Resistance Army. After a quarter century of merciless brutality, the L.R.A. should not be tolerated, let alone helped, by anyone,"" said Power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Security Council issued a statement praising the progress made against the L.R.A. and saying that momentum must continue until the rebels are no longer a threat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It cited estimates from the U.N. humanitarian agency showing a dramatic decrease in the number of people displaced by the L.R.A., dropping from 420,000 people in March 2013 to 160,000 in March of this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kony waged a brutal guerrilla war against the Ugandan government for nearly two decades before fleeing with his fighters to the jungles of central Africa around 2005. He is believed to have no more than a few hundred fighters remaining. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.","Joseph Kony has named his 22-year-old son as deputy leader of his Lord's Resistance Army—and top Ugandan general Sam Kavuma says the move is a sign that Kony's control over the guerrilla force is weakening. Fighters have separated into different autonomous groups roaming across remote parts of Africa, and ""the role of the son is an indication Kony has lost contact with most of his commanders, some who have been killed by our forces and others are in disarray, with the rebels becoming weaker,"" Kavuma says, according to AFP. Salim Saleh is said to have spent his life fighting with his father's violent rebel forces. ""Previously the son was in charge of the group providing security to the father, but now he has an added responsibility of field command,"" Kavuma says. The LRA continues to evade Ugandan troops and US special forces attempting to hunt it down. In November, there were reports Kony was ill and his reign might be nearing an end. In a report last week, the UN said Kony is hiding in a Sudanese-controlled area of the disputed border between South Sudan and the Central African Republic, al-Jazeera reports, and Voice of America adds that a UN official predicted Kony's capture is ""coming pretty soon."""

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But hunting, or rather the display of animal trophies, has become a reviled activity in some corners of social media, as well-heeled individuals, including the older sons of President Trump, proudly display their trophies for the world to see on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The killing of Cecil the lion by an American dentist, Dr. Walter J.

Two years later, the lion’s son Xanda was killed in a trophy hunt near the same park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since then, photographs of hunters posing triumphantly with the bodies of animals such as giraffes and a family of baboons have stirred global condemnation. In the latter case, the Idaho fish and game commissioner seen grinning with an array of carcasses from an African hunting trip resigned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While many defenders of hunting see it as an honorable, skilled and bonding experience, others denounce it as unnecessary waste in the modern age and detrimental to the environment and to the animals who roam in the wild. But the issue is more complex than a clash of cultures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some countries like Zimbabwe encourage big-game hunting as a source of income, and others allow the activity to keep down herd populations through managed hunting trips and as a way to pay for the upkeep of game reserves.

"PORTAGE, MI — A local Democratic state House candidate is crying foul after the Michigan GOP sent out campaign mailers this week directing Republicans to call him at a number for his 91-year-old mother's room at a Portage-based nursing home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mailers, which were paid for by the Michigan Republican Party, urge voters to call John Fisher, a candidate for the 61st state House District, and ""Tell him hard-working Michiganders are being hurt by Obamacare and the health care policies (Democrats) support."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fisher's campaign acknowledged it had no issue with past Republican mailers that told voters to call him at his personal number, but the candidate said Republicans took it too far by directing citizens to call Fisher at his mother's number.

(NEWSCHANNEL 3) - The Newschannel 3 I-Team is taking a closer look at what some are calling a case of politics at its worst. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When it comes to political ads and campaigns, especially in an election year, fact and fiction are never easily separated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Newschannel 3 worked with both sides of the aisle Thursday night, and gave it a shot in the name of bipartisanship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now that 91-year-old Isabel Kramb's son, Reverend John Fisher, is running for office, she's getting a good dose of politics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Frustrating doesn't begin to touch it,"" Fisher said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It started with Fisher received a mailer directing voters to call and complain about the Affordable Care Act at a number he didn't recognize. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""When I dialed it, it came up on my cellphone, and it said, 'Mom,'"" Fisher said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It turns out, he wasn't the only one to call her at her nursing home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I said, 'I'm sorry, he's not here, I'm his mother,'"" Kramb said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Michigan Republican Party says they accept responsibility for the mailer, and sent a statement which apologized for any distress that was caused, adding that it wasn't their intention to have people call Fisher's mother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""You have to dig to find this phone number being connected with me,"" Fisher said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Republican Party says it found the number under John Fisher on an Internet directory, which Newschannel 3 was also able to do in a matter of minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It's just unconscionable that people would be steered to call her and complain,"" Fisher said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newschannel 3 also asked Fisher if wheeling his mother out of her nursing home to talk about the unconsionable acts by Republicans wasn't equally underhanded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I don't know how it could be underhanded to try to remind people not to call my mom,"" Fisher said. ""I'm doing it in part to point out the lack of responsibility and thoughtfulness which is what I'm running against."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newschannel 3 left several messages for the Republican candidate in the 61st State District House race, Kalamazoo County Commissioner Brandt Iden, but we have not received a comment on the incident from his campaign.","John Fisher has no beef with voters calling him on his personal phone, but please don't call his 91-year-old mother. The Michigan Democrat, who's running for a state House seat, is fired up after a GOP campaign mailer was sent out this week telling people in the city of Portage to call him and ""tell him hard-working Michiganders are being hurt by ObamaCare and the health care policies [Democrats] support."" Which would've been fine, except the phone number on the mailer was the direct line to his mother's room at a local nursing home, where she's being given hospice care for congestive heart failure, Fisher's campaign manager tells Michigan Live. Fisher didn't recognize the number when he got his hands on the mailer. ""When I dialed it, it came up on my cellphone, and it said, 'Mom,'"" he tells WWMT. Meanwhile, Isabel Kramb fielded her son's calls from her room, giving a stock answer of ""I'm sorry, he's not here, I'm his mother,"" she tells the station. The Michigan GOP says it discovered the number online under Fisher's name and apologized ""for any distress that was caused"" by Kramb receiving the phone calls. In a statement cited by Michigan Live, Fisher railed on the campaign promo, noting that ""to direct people to call a suffering woman who deserves peace and comfort is beyond the pale."" He also spoke about the mailer outside the nursing home—with his mother present. WMMT asked him if that was perhaps also in poor taste. ""I don't know how it could be underhanded to try to remind people not to call my mom,"" Fisher said."
"Google grabs for 90% of Microsoft Office users NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft has two bread-and-butter software products that generate the vast majority of the company's revenue.

"Donald Trump Ex-Driver Sues ... I Didn't Get a Raise for 10 Years!!! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald Trump's Personal Driver Sues for a Ton of Overtime Pay NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXCLUSIVE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The man who drove Donald Trump everywhere before he was President says he was getting financially screwed for years ... and now he's looking for the big payback. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Noel Cintron says he was Trump's personal driver for more than 20 years until the Secret Service took that gig in 2016 -- and he says the last ""meaningful"" raise he got was more than a decade ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a lawsuit, Noel says he was making $62,700 per year and, in 2006, he got bumped up to $68,000. Great, right? Well, Noel says he got another raise in 2010, but this time Trump pulled a fast one on him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the suit, obtained by TMZ, he says his salary jumped up to $75k annually -- but, at the same time, he was forced to surrender his health benefits, which he says saved the Trump Corporation nearly $18k per year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Noel also claims to have worked about 3,300 hours of uncompensated overtime during his last 6 years on the job. Based on Noel's OT rate, he says he'd be owed about $178k ... just for the overtime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He's suing the Trump Corporation for lost wages and damages.  LISTEN TO ARTICLE 2:57 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald Trump’s personal driver for more than 25 years says the billionaire real estate developer didn’t pay him overtime and raised his salary only twice in 15 years, clawing back the second raise by cutting off his health benefits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Noel Cintron, who is listed in public records as a registered Republican, sued the Trump Organization for about 3,300 hours of overtime that he says he worked in the past six years. He’s not allowed to sue for overtime prior to that due to the statute of limitations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In an utterly callous display of unwarranted privilege and entitlement and without even a minimal sense of noblesse oblige,” Trump and his businesses exploited the driver, Cintron says in the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The driver’s allegations echo those of other Trump employees or contractors who have sued the president or his businesses over the years claiming he has underpaid them or failed to honor promises to compensate them for their work. They have included mortgage brokers, landscapers and electricians who say they were stiffed on commissions or fees. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, one of Trump’s luxury golf resorts in Florida was ordered by an appeals court to pay more than $32,000 to a supply company that claimed it wasn’t paid for paint that was used to spruce up the property. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr. Cintron was at all times paid generously and in accordance with the law,” Trump Organization spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement. “Once the facts come out we expect to be fully vindicated in court.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald Trump Will See You in Court NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cintron says he was required to be on duty for Trump starting at 7 a.m. each day until whenever Trump, his family or business associates no longer required his services. He worked as long as 55 hours per week, but was paid a fixed salary of $62,700 in 2003, $68,000 in 2006, and $75,000 in 2010, according to the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wage bump in 2010 came with a catch, Cintron said. He was induced to surrender his health insurance, saving Trump approximately $17,866 per year in premiums, according to the lawsuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""President Trump’s further callousness and cupidity is further demonstrated by the fact that while he is purportedly a billionaire, he has not given his personal driver a meaningful raise in over 12 years!"" Cintron said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cintron, 59, lives in Queens, New York, his lawyer, Larry Hutcher, said in a phone interview. The driver started working for the Trump Organization about 30 years ago, and worked his way up to chauffeuring the president-to-be. He declined to comment to reporters outside his home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cintron said he was Trump’s personal driver until the Secret Service took over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the unpaid overtime, Cintron claims the Trump Organization failed to provide annual wage notices as required by New York law. Cintron is seeking about $200,000 in damages, Hutcher said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case is Cintron v. Trump Organization LLC, Supreme Court, State of New York (Manhattan). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR — With assistance by Erik Larson","President Trump's longtime personal driver says the billionaire exploited him in an ""utterly callous display of unwarranted privilege and entitlement."" Noel Cintron is suing the Trump Organization, claiming he was stiffed for around 3,300 hours in overtime over six years and didn't receive a ""meaningful"" raise for more than a decade, TMZ reports. The 59-year-old says he joined the Trump Organization more than 30 years ago and served as Trump's chauffeur for around 20 years until the Secret Service took over in 2016. He says he worked at least 50 hours a week but was paid a flat yearly salary, which rose to $75,000 in 2010, instead of time-and-a-half for overtime as required under New York law, reports the Washington Post. Cintron—whose lawyer says he is still employed by the Trump Organization—is seeking more than $200,000 in compensation for overtime worked over six years, which is as far back as his lawsuit can go under the statute of limitations, Bloomberg reports. According to his lawsuit, on one of the few occasions he received a raise, Cintron ended up losing money because the organization forced him to give up his health benefits. His lawsuit slams Trump for his ""callousness and cupidity."" The Trump Organization says it will fight the lawsuit. Cintron ""was at all times paid generously and in accordance with the law,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. ""Once the facts come out we expect to be fully vindicated in court."""

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This would pit the e-commerce giant against the likes of FedEx and UPS.

The 2007-2009 recession, already in the record books as the worst in the 66 years since the end... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From the start of the recession at the end of 2007 to the end in June of 2009, the U.S. economy shrank 5.1 percent. That is 1 percentage point worse than the previous estimate that the recession reduced total output during that period by 4.1 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new estimates emerged from the annual revision of economic data prepared by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and released Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the previous 10 postwar recessions, output in only two dropped by more 3 percent. In the 1957-58 recession, the economy contracted 3.7 percent. And during the 1973-1975 downturn, the economy fell 3.2 percent from the start of the recession to the end. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government attributed the bigger declines in output in part to weaker consumer spending and business investment than previously estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By year, the government's new figures show that the economy took a much bigger hit in 2009, when output shrank 3.5 percent. The previous estimate had shown a decline of 2.5 percent that year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2008, the new estimate shows the economy contracted by 0.3 percent. The previous estimate had indicated that output was unchanged for that year compared with 2007. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The last recession began in December 2007 and lasted until June 2009. Though the economy has been growing since then, growth has been subpar. And the unemployment rate has remained elevated; it's now 9.2 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revisions showed that growth in 2010 was a bit stronger than previously estimated. They put growth for all of 2010 at 3 percent, up from a previous estimate that the economy grew 2.9 percent last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revisions to the country's gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, used more complete data for such items as consumer and business spending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government's annual revisions are released each July, along with its first estimate of growth for the April-June quarter of the current year.","We already knew the Great Recession was the worst in decades, but in fact we were even worse off than we thought, new figures show. The economy shrank 5.1% over the course of the recession, from 2007 to 2009—1 percentage point worse than the earlier estimate of 4.1%, the AP reports. Only two in the past 10 recessions saw a squeeze of more than 3%. And yes, the economy is now growing—but it expanded only 1.3% from April to June, the Commerce Department said, lower than expected. Officials also revised the growth figure for the first three months of the year to 0.4%, compared to an earlier estimate of 1.9%. That means that the past 6 months have seen the least growth since the end of the recession. Among the reasons: Gas prices, less consumer spending, and smaller government, notes the Atlantic. Combine these figures with the debt ceiling crisis, and it’s “like hearing about the Hindenburg on the day the 6-mile meteor hits the earth,” said a blogger."

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump escalated his attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday, suggesting the Department of Justice put Republicans in midterm jeopardy with recent indictments of two GOP congressmen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his latest broadside against the Justice Department's traditional independence, Trump tweeted that ""Obama era investigations, of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added: ""Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff......"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president's striking suggestion that the Justice Department consider politics when making decisions showed his disregard for the agency's independence. Trump has frequently suggested he views Justice less as a law enforcement agency and more as a department that is supposed to do his personal and political bidding. Still, investigators are never supposed to take into account the political affiliations of the people they investigate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, who did not address the specifics of the charges, did not name the Republicans. But he was apparently referring to the first two Republicans to endorse him in the GOP presidential primaries. Both were indicted on separate charges last month: Rep. Duncan Hunter of California on charges that included spending campaign funds for personal expenses and Rep. Chris Collins of New York on insider trading. Both have proclaimed their innocence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Hunter investigation began in June 2016, according to the indictment. The indictment into Collins lays out behavior from 2017. He was also under investigation by congressional ethics officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hunter has not exited his race, while Collins ended his re-election bid days after his indictment. Both seats appear likely to remain in GOP hands, but the charges have raised Democratic hopes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokeswoman for Sessions declined comment, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump did not have any public events Monday. He briefly exited the White House to a waiting motorcade, but then went back inside without going anywhere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He has previously pressed Sessions to investigate his perceived enemies and has accused Sessions of failing to take control of the Justice Department. Trump has also repeatedly complained publicly and privately over Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the federal investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia because he'd worked on Trump's campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of the issues Trump has raised have either already been examined or are being investigated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tension between Trump and Sessions boiled over recently with Sessions punching back, saying that he and his department ""will not be improperly influenced by political considerations."" Still, Sessions has made clear to associates that he has no intention of leaving his job voluntarily despite Trump's constant criticism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Allies, including Republican members of Congress, have long advised Trump that firing Sessions — especially before the November midterm elections — would be deeply damaging to the party. But some have indicated that Trump may make a change after the elections.

""The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated,"" Jenner writes in The Secrets of My Life, per Radar. She had indicated back in 2016 during an I Am Cait episode that she wasn't sure when or if she'd undergo the procedure, which for a person born male means removing the penis and creating a vagina. She apparently decided to go for it, however, and to tell her fans in the interest of ""candor""—and so everyone would quit bugging her about whether she'd had it done or not.

"California judge throws out Jesse Graham’s $42m lawsuit that alleged the pop star stole his lyrics in a judgment that liberally quotes Swift’s songs NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A California judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed against Taylor Swift in a cheekily worded ruling that quotes lyrics from the pop star’s songs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this month, R&B artist Jessie Braham, who records as Jesse Graham, issued a $42m lawsuit against Swift, accusing the singer of lifting his lyrics for her hit Shake It Off. Braham alleged that although Shake It Off bore no melodic resemblance to his song Haters Gone Hate, Swift took the distinctive lyrics from the chorus of his song, which appears on the album Sexy Ladies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Graham sings: “Haters gonna hate/ Players gonna play/ Watch out for them fakers/ They’ll fake you every day.” Swift’s chorus runs: “’Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play/ And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR US district court judge Gail Standish took the opportunity to show off her knowledge of Swift’s repertoire. While throwing out the suit, Standish invoked lyrics from Swift’s other hits, including We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, Blank Space and Bad Blood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “At present, the Court is not saying that Braham can never, ever, ever get his case back in court. But, for now, we have got problems, and the Court is not sure Braham can solve them,” Standish wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standish ruled that Braham did not provide enough factual evidence and that his allegations did not go beyond a speculative level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As currently drafted, the Complaint has a blank space – one that requires Braham to do more than write his name. And, upon consideration of the Court’s explanation in Part II, Braham may discover that mere pleading BandAids will not fix the bullet holes in his case,” Standish wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Braham could fix the deficiencies of the lawsuit, he could file a new complaint, the court said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standish concluded: “At least for the moment, Defendants have shaken off this lawsuit.”  Story highlights Lawsuit accused Swift of stealing lyrics for ""Shake It Off"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jessie Braham claimed 92% of Swift's song came from his song ""Haters Gone Hate"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (CNN) If you sue Taylor Swift, just remember her lyrics might be used against you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's what a California judge did Tuesday when she dismissed a copyright lawsuit against the pop star that accused her of stealing another artist's lyrics for her hit song ""Shake It Off."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United States District Court Judge Gail Standish cheekily quoted lyrics from other Swift songs as she tossed the suit filed by musician Jessie Braham. He claimed that his song ""Haters Gone Hate"" had the same 22-word phrase that Swift used in her song. Braham said he copyrighted ""Haters Gone Hate"" in February 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Braham claimed in the lawsuit that 92% of Taylor Swift's song came from his song. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Swift's song has the lyrics: ""Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play. And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate,"" as well as ""And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake."" It was included on her hit album ""1989,"" which she released in 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read More","If a judge is a big enough Taylor Swift fan to repeatedly quote her lyrics within a ruling, should they not be required to recuse themselves from any case involving the pop star? That's the legal conundrum we're left with after judge Gail Standish used references to at least four of Swift's hits to dismiss a plagiarism lawsuit brought against her by an R&B singer, the Guardian reports. Earlier this month, Jesse Graham—who says he hasn't had a job in nine years—sued Swift for $42 million and a songwriting credit, claiming she stole 92% of the lyrics to her hit Shake It Off from his song Haters Gone Hate, according to CNN. Graham says he copyrighted his song a year before Shake It Off was released. Shake It Off includes the lyrics ""Cause the players gonna play; and the haters gonna hate,"" as well as ""And the fakers gonna fake,"" the Guardian reports. Meanwhile, the chorus to Graham's song goes ""Haters gone hate; players gone play; watch out for them fakers; they'll fake you everyday."" Standish said the lawsuit was based on speculation and lacked enough evidence. In her ruling, she wrote: “At present, the Court is not saying that [Graham] can never, ever, ever get his case back in court. But, for now, we have got problems, and the Court is not sure [Graham] can solve them.""

"Enlarge Image Steven Ewing/Roadshow NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The turn signal is a marvelous invention. It elegantly communicates your intent to move your 4,000-pound guided missile from one space to another, thus minimizing the chance that the driver of a similar missile will be occupying the same space. It's like magic, but I live in Los Angeles where nobody uses their signals and that's why this new Tesla patent filing is especially exciting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tesla wants its vehicles to signal automatically without the driver needing to go through the agony that is lifting their finger and moving it up or down by several inches. The way that Tesla envisions it working is that the car detects the driver's intent to change lanes or make a turn by using the Autopilot hardware at its disposal, it then works to sense if there are other vehicles nearby and if it detects them, it puts the signal on for the driver. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cool, right? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it works, it will be brilliant but given the fact that Tesla has remained adamant that it doesn't need driver monitoring systems for Autopilot, it seems questionable that the vehicle would be able to detect a driver's intent to turn based solely on external observation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are plenty of systems out now from other manufacturers that will offer drivers a warning to use their signals after repeated turns or lane changes without them, but because those ultimately rely on the driver moving their finger and physically activating the signal, they're not that helpful. People are just lazy, what can we say? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge Image Tesla NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anyway, I hope this patent actually makes it into a vehicle, since many patents don't. They're most often secured by manufacturers as a means of hampering the competition's ability to develop a technology but in this case, if it works, it could really do some good. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We've reached out to Tesla for additional information on this patent, but it has not immediately responded to requests for comment.  Tesla has filed for a new patent that describes a technology to automate turn signals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surprisingly, it sounds like the technology is actually not for self-driving cars, but for drivers who forget/don’t use turn signals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has happened to most of us at one point or another. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A car swerves in your lane without signaling or a car slows down to take an exit without activating their turn signal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At best, it’s annoying and at worst, it’s dangerous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tesla appears to have a solution. By leveraging its Autopilot technology, the automaker thinks it can detect when a driver should activate its turn signal and do it for them if they forget it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company describes the system in the patent application: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “An embodiment includes a method of automated turn signaling, the method comprising: determining, via the processor, that a vehicle will cross a lane line or turn based on a measured steering angle value that is within a value range stored in a memory, wherein the car includes the processor, the memory, and the turn signal source; and activating, via the processor, the turn signal source based on the determination that a vehicle will cross a lane line or turn.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s a flowchart that explains when the system would activate the turn signal for the driver: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tesla has applied for an international patent to use its sensors and onboard processor to make this work. There’s no word on when or even if the technology will make its way into Tesla’s vehicles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s the full patent application: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Electrek’s Take NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It sounds like Tesla might have been working on detecting when it should activate its turn signal when the vehicle is driving automatically and figured out that it could also be useful technology when drivers are manually driving their vehicles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, it’s not a reason to not activate your turn signal since any good driver knows that you should activate it before taking any action and not when you are just about to cross a lane line, but it is certainly better than no turn signal at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for automated turn signals for autonomous driving, Tesla is definitely working on that too since the company said that it plans to release the Autopilot ‘On Ramp/Off Ramp’ feature in the version 9.0 update next month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The feature would reportedly enable Autopilot to drive on its own on the highway without inputs from the driver, including lanes changes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Currently, Tesla drivers can initiate a lane change on Autopilot but they have to make sure the way is clear and activate the turn signal – only then will Autopilot drive the car in the next lane.","Activating a turn signal takes just a flick of the finger, but that simple move apparently is too much for lots of drivers out there. A new patent filing by Tesla seeks to change that. The company envisions an automated signal, one that senses when a driver is getting ready to turn and activates the blinker on its own, reports CNET. What Electrek finds surprising about the patent application is that it appears to be designed for use with human drivers, not with self-driving cars. The technology stems from Tesla's Autopilot function. (A Tesla in Canada managed to fly, sort of.)"

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anurag, who was nearly lynched and had to be hospitalised, told the police that he loved Jayshree, a doctor posted in the children’s ward of the Gandhi Medical College in Bhopal, and could not bear to see her getting married to another man. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jayshree got engaged to Rohit Namdeo, a post-graduate student of surgery in the same college, on February 3.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jayshree and Anurag went to the same coaching institute in Bhopal a few years ago when, he told the police, he fell in love with her. In a Facebook post immediately after her engagement he talked about taking his life. A frequent Facebook user, he also posted photographs posing with a rifle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He recently changed the cover photo of his account to the words “JUST WAIT AND WATCH” in red background. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jayshree’s father said he had not invited his sister’s family to the wedding when he learnt that his nephew was against it. “We never thought he would go that far,” her father Ghanashyam said on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anurag was not stopped from entering the marriage venue because he was known to be a relative. He had carried a country-made pistol from Gadhakota, Sagar, and waited near the stage for an hour or so before getting close to his target. Jayshree was rushed to a nearby private hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anurag was bleeding severely and lying on the ground near the stage when the police arrived and took him away. SP Arvind Saxena said Anurag had come well-prepared and did not repent killing his cousin saying that’s all he wanted to do after she refused to marry him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jayshree’s father Ghanashyam retired as a supervisor from Madhya Pradesh Power Generating Company. Anurag is the son of his younger sister. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anurag lost his father some time ago and earned a modest salary as a supervisor with a private bank he joined in October 2012. Ghanashyam reportedly helped Anurag after his father’s death. Anurag had stayed in Ghanashyam’s house five years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Besides his gender and date of birth, the only basic information Anurag provided on his Facebook account was: “Interested in.. women.”","In hindsight, the words ""Just watch and wait"" on his Facebook page may have been a warning. Disguised as a photographer, Anurag Singh, 31, walked into his cousin's wedding in India this week and shot her dead as she was saying her vows, the Daily Mail reports. Several reports say he did it because she ""cheated him,"" but the Indian Express and Times of India go into greater detail, portraying Singh as a man lovestruck by Jayshree Namdeo, 26, ever since he lived in her family's house five years ago while doing his bank exams. Namdeo, a pediatrician, refused his hand in marriage, and Singh reacted to her engagement by saying on Facebook that he might kill himself. Her family knew about his opposition to the marriage but ""never thought he would go that far,"" the bride's father said. At the wedding in Bhopal, Singh waited the near the stage for an hour before shooting Namdeo, and tried to shoot the groom and himself but only grazed himself and injured a guest. The crowd savagely beat Singh before police arrived and took him away. Beyond Singh's banking career (described in one report as ""modest""), all that's known about him was written on his Facebook account: ""Interested in.. women."""

And—in a policy that already exists for phones and other recording devices—if theater staff thinks you're recording illegally, they'll notify police. The new zero-tolerance policy was approved during the ShowEast convention, where theater owners gather each year, according to the Hollywood Reporter; the Washington Post reports that the association represents about 32,000 US theaters.

"Rolling Stone, the bible of rock 'n' roll for a half-century, is for sale, Jann Wenner, the magazine's swaggering co-founder, said Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York Times first reported the intended sale of Wenner's 51 percent stake on Sunday. Wenner's company, Wenner Media, confirmed the report Sunday night, saying in a statement that it was looking at ""strategic options ... to best position the brand for future growth."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rolling Stone editor and publisher Jann Wenner at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in Los Angeles in 2013. AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I love my job, I enjoy it, I've enjoyed it for a long time,"" Wenner, 71, told The Times. But selling now is ""just the smart thing to do,"" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since he co-founded it with Ralph Gleason in 1967, Rolling Stone and Wenner have been synonymous, writing the history of rock 'n' roll in a style equal parts reverent and irreverent, promoted by some of the most famous covers in American publishing history. Gleason died in 1975. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Along the way, it published some of the most important political and investigative writers of the last 50 years, as well, among them Hunter S. Thompson, whose ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" made its debut in the magazine in 1971; Washington insider Joe Klein, the author of ""Primary Colors""; conservative provocateur P.J. O'Rourke; and Tom Wolfe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, the magazine settled a defamation lawsuit brought by a fraternity at the University of Virginia, which said its 2014 investigation ""A Rape on Campus"" was significantly false.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wenner sold 49 percent of his stake in Rolling Stone in 2013 to a digital music startup. He recently sold the company's other magazines, Us Weekly and Men's Journal, to American Media Inc., publisher of The National Enquirer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We have made great strides transforming Rolling Stone into a multi-platform company, and we are thrilled to find the right home to build on our strong foundation and grow the business exponentially,"" said Wenner's son Gus Wenner, the company's president and chief operating officer, whom The Times credited with engineering the planned sale.  But that was perhaps the last Rolling Stone cover piece that gained significant journalistic acclaim. And the magazine’s reputation as a tastemaker for the music world had long since eroded, as Mr. Wenner clung to the past with covers that featured artists from his generation, even as younger artists emerged. Artists like Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan have continued to secure cover spots in recent years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rolling Stone suffered a devastating blow to its reputation when it retracted a debunked 2014 article about a gang rape at the University of Virginia. A damning report on the story by the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism cited fundamental journalistic failures. The article prompted three libel lawsuits against Rolling Stone, one of which led to a highly publicized trial last year that culminated with a federal jury awarding the plaintiff $3 million in damages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The financial picture had also been bleak. In 2001, Jann Wenner sold a 50 percent stake in Us Weekly to the Walt Disney Company for $40 million, then borrowed $300 million five years later to buy back the stake. The deal saddled the company with debt for more than a decade, preventing it from investing as much as it might have in its magazines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the same time, Rolling Stone’s print advertising revenue and newsstand sales fell. And as readers increasingly embraced the web for their news and entertainment, Mr. Wenner remained skeptical, with a stubbornness that hamstrung his company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wenner Media was already a small magazine publisher. But the sale of Us Weekly and Men’s Journal, which together brought in roughly three-quarters of Wenner Media’s revenue, has left it further diminished. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regardless, the sale of Rolling Stone would be Jann Wenner’s denouement, capping his unlikely rise from dope-smoking Berkeley dropout to silver-haired media mogul. An admirer of John Lennon and publishing mavens like William Randolph Hearst, Mr. Wenner — who invested $7,500 of borrowed money to start Rolling Stone along with his mentor, Ralph J. Gleason — was at turns idealist and desperado, crafting his magazine into a guide for the counterculture epoch while also gallivanting with superstars. He once boasted that he had turned down a $500 million offer for Rolling Stone, more than he could ever dream of getting for the magazine today. (BandLab invested $40 million to acquire its 49-percent stake in the magazine last year.)","After nearly a half-century tracking trends in rock and culture, Rolling Stone is up for sale. Trailblazing editor Jann Wenner, 71, tells the New York Times he is making way for new blood by hawking his 51% controlling stake in the magazine. ""I love my job,” says Wenner, but selling is ""just the smart thing to do."" Wenner Media confirms the sale to NBC News, saying it was investigating ""strategic options ... to best position the brand for future growth."" Wenner sold 49% of his stake in Rolling Stone in 2013, and more recently two other magazines run by Wenner Media. But those moves weren't enough to turn the financial tide after decades of plummeting ad revenue. ""There’s a level of ambition that we can’t achieve alone,"" his son and company president, Gus Wenner, tells the Times. ""So we are being proactive ... Publishing is a completely different industry than what it was."" Gus Wenner, who crafted the sale, and his father say they'd like to stay on, though they recognize the new buyer might wish otherwise. But Jann Wenner concedes that ""it's time for young people"" to have a crack at running the glossy known for its edgy pieces—but badly bruised by a $3 million libel verdict over the botched University of Virginia gang rape story. The sale process is just beginning. One candidate is American Media, which recently bought Wenner Media's other titles, Us Weekly and Men's Journal. Music critic Anthony DeCurtis worries over the magazine's future. ""That sense of the magazine editor’s hands on the magazine,"" he tells the Times, ""that’s what’s going to get lost here.""

"10 worst cities for spring allergies NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR share tweet pin email NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you think your seasonal allergies this spring are worse than ever, you just may live in Louisville, Ky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's the city that tops the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America's list of 2014 Spring Allergy Capitals, the most challenging places to live if pollen, mold and other airborne allergens make you say, ""Achoo!"" Louisville moves up to the top of the list from the No. 5 spot last year, due to higher than average pollen counts, high use of allergy medications by people who live in the region and too few allergy specialists in the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The river provides a basin affect that traps allergens … plus the temperate climate and precipitation encourages plenty of pollen growth for patients out here,” said Louisville allergist Dr. Gerald Lee. His allergy clinic has seen a 20 percent increase in visits over the past three years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Nancy Snyderman, chief medical editor for NBC News, says a long growing season and new growth combine to make this spring especially sneezy, stuffy, and sniffly for the estimated 40 million Americans who suffer from seasonal allergies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Certainly there's evidence that because plants are growing in places that they haven't before, that the growing season is longer, which means there is a chance for a longer exposure to plants that might cause problems and it could make that worse,” Snyderman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seasonal allergies include symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, itchy eyes, runny nose and scratchy throat. Snyderman says most allergy sufferers can feel better by avoiding the allergens. She recommends that people run early in the morning when the dew keeps the pollen from releasing into the air, for example. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Most people can avoid the allergies by avoiding the problem,” she said. “[A]voiding a lot of outdoor activity when the pollen is stirred up in the air [can help].” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's a list of the top 10 cities — interestingly, all in the South — that are the worst offenders: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1.

"Man admits to killing retired nun in 2012 Posted: Tuesday, April 1, 2014 1:45 PM EDT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SCHENECTADY, N.Y. – A man has pleaded guilty to killing a former nun in December 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schenectady County officials have confirmed that Michael Briggs, 38, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and attempted burglary on Monday in county court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Briggs admitted to strangling Mary Greco, 82, in her apartment in 2012. She was found on New Year's Day 2013. Briggs had shoveled snow for Greco around the time she was killed, said officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time of the murder, Briggs was on parole in Long Island for a burglary and robbery.  Toilet seat helps doom killer Clues galore clinch guilty plea in retired nun's 2012 killing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Michael Briggs (Albany County Sheriff's Department) Michael Briggs (Albany County Sheriff's Department) Toilet seat helps doom killer 1 / 1 Back to Gallery NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schenectady NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Sgt. Darryl Mallard arrived at the scene of Mary Greco's murder, he saw a blanket that her killer had draped over the retired nun's body. He noticed coffee mugs and glassware in the kitchen of her Stanford Street home. The veteran cop spotted something in the bathroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The toilet seat was up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 82-year-old woman lived alone. Perhaps, Mallard hypothesized, the killer was a man who also used her bathroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fingerprints lifted from the toilet's handle matched those of Michael Briggs, a 38-year-old robber on parole. Those prints would become part of a ream of evidence, large and small, that connected Briggs to Greco's murder in 2012, a crime he confessed to Monday, a week before his trial was to start. He will be sentenced in June to 30 years to life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Greco was a deeply spiritual, soft-spoken woman. The longtime parishioner at St. Luke's Roman Catholic Church on State Street volunteered as a teacher on international mission trips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Briggs lived a short walk from Greco's home near Vale Cemetery. The two crossed paths on Dec 27, 2012, when Briggs offered to shovel Greco's car out after a snowstorm. She paid him in cash and cookies, prosecutors said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More Information NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three days later, on the morning of Dec. 30, Briggs returned after nearly half a foot of snow blanketed the city. As he again cleared off Greco's car, she called her neighbor and asked if she wanted Briggs to shovel her car out as well. The neighbor declined. That, said District Attorney Robert Carney, was last time Greco spoke with anyone but her killer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After strangling and stabbing her, Briggs stole Greco's car. It was later found in a nearby church parking lot. A rosary with Swarovski amethyst beads and a 2-inch sterling silver crucifix, a gift to her just days before, was never found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Greco's call to her neighbor helped authorities put Briggs at the scene. So did the fingerprints from the toilet and others lifted from a coffee mug on the kitchen counter and a glass in the sink. Briggs' fingerprints were in Greco's car as well. His DNA turned up on the blanket that covered her body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most crucial piece of evidence, however, was video surveillance footage that showed Briggs leaving his home, snow shovel in hand, and walking toward Greco's just before she was killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""There was everything a jury could sink their teeth into,"" said Michael Mansion, Briggs' attorney, who struck a plea deal after seeing the video for the first time Friday NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""As I got myself deeper and deeper into trial preparation, it became pretty apparent there was more than sufficient evidence for a jury to find a guilty verdict on all counts,"" said Mansion, who took over as assigned counsel for Briggs last fall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Briggs was released from prison in 2007 after serving 10 years of a 15-year sentence for a robbery in Nassau County. In that crime, Carney said, Briggs tied up a 12-year-old boy and sexually assaulted him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time of Greco's killing, Briggs had violated parole and was being sought by authorities, Carney said. That factored into Carney's decision to agree to a plea to second-degree murder and burglary rather than take the case to trial. Given Briggs' violent history and the fact he was had violated parole just before the murder, Carney said he can't envision any parole board ever letting Briggs out of prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR bfitzgerald@timesunion.com • 518-454-5414 • @BFitzgeraldTU","A Schenectady man confessed this week to the horrendous crime of murdering a retired nun in her own home, reports News10. And the Albany Times Union notes that police caught 38-year-old Michael Briggs thanks in part to a dumb move on his part at the crime scene: He used the toilet and left the seat up. It caught the attention of a detective who wondered why an 82-year-old woman who lived alone would have the seat in that position, and, sure enough, Briggs' fingerprints turned up on the toilet handle. Police had other evidence, including surveillance video that showed him leaving his house with a snow shovel and heading toward the victim's house shortly before she was killed. But the prints (he left some elsewhere, too) put him inside the house, and defense lawyers opted to have him plead guilty. Briggs will get 30 years to life, and the DA doesn't expect he'll ever be a free man again."

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also consulted doctors in neighbouring India, but he and his family could not afford the cost of the operation there.","A father and former bicycle puller is gearing up for major surgery at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital in Bangladesh to remove more than 11 pounds of bark-like warts on his hands and feet that have earned him the nickname ""tree man."" The 26-year-old tells AFP he has suffered from what doctors call epidermodysplasia verruciformis for a decade, but that the growths dramatically increased in size and number four years ago. ""Slowly I lost all my ability to work,"" says Abul Bajandar. ""There are now dozens of two to three inch roots in both my hands. And there are some small ones in my legs."" The genetic skin disease is so rare that one doctor says there are only three known cases in the world. At first Bajandar says he tried to cut the growths off himself but found it too painful, and when he went to a village homeopath his condition worsened. And while the six-person medical team is already starting to perform blood tests and biopsies, they describe Bajandar as too malnourished and weak for multi-stage plastic surgery, reports the Daily Star. ""Doctors said I might need to stay here for six months,"" he said. His mother and sister are with him now, while his wife and 3-year-old daughter will join him soon.

Surgery is expected to start in three weeks, and the hospital is not charging Bajandar. (This baby's skin blisters when simply touched.)"
"Hong Kong has long been one of Tesla’s biggest markets, but it may not be for much longer—not a single newly purchased Tesla model was registered in April, according to data from Hong Kong’s transport department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plunge in interest in Tesla cars came after the government eliminated tax breaks for electric-vehicle (EV) owners, a policy that went into effect on April 1 and is expected to last until March next year. Now, the city has capped the tax waiver at HK$97,500 ($12,500) on private EVs, and is only applicable to first-time owners. There were 2,939 first-time Tesla registrations in March just before the new tax rules kicked in, around five times that of the number in February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a result, it now costs HK$925, 500 ($118,400) for a Tesla Model S 60, compared to HK$570,000 ($72,900) before the new tax policy—giving it little or no price advantage over a Mercedes-Benz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First-time registrations don’t exactly equal to sales, but is nevertheless a useful proxy as the car needs to be registered in order to run on the road in Hong Kong, said (paywall) the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story. Hong Kong had 11,004 EVs in use as of May this year, including privately owned and public transport vehicles, according to Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection Department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Tesla spokesperson wrote to Quartz that the company’s business did not “rely on” government policies and the company believed that Hong Kong market would continue to be “very strong”: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hong Kong remains a significant market for Tesla and we continue to sell cars there each quarter. When the Hong Kong Government reduced the tax exemption for electric vehicles and increased the cost of our cars by nearly 100%, it’s to be expected that demand will be impacted in the period immediately following the change, particularly because of the large number who bought just prior to the change being implemented. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, new registrations for EVs in Hong Kong grew almost three times from 2014, Tesla said. Its Model S vehicles made up 70% of the city’s nearly 4,200 EVs in 2015. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the city’s tax waiver for EVs was “excellent.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As interest in Tesla starts to wane in Hong Kong, the company has set its sights firmly on mainland China, where it plans to establish a manufacturing facility which would allow Tesla to dodge import taxes that are as high as 50% of the vehicle’s price. In 2016, China registered as many as 352,000 new EVs, compared to America’s 159,000 in the same period, a number that is set to increase as the government continues its fight against air pollution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The piece has been updated with response from Tesla on July 10.  Tesla Inc.’s sales in Hong Kong came to a standstill after authorities slashed a tax break for electric vehicles on April 1, demonstrating how sensitive the company’s performance can be to government incentive programs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not a single newly purchased Tesla model was registered in Hong Kong in April, according to official data from the city’s...","The weekend brought photos of Tesla's first Model 3 sedan to roll off the production line, but it wasn't all positive news for the automaker. The Wall Street Journal on Sunday posted an analysis of data out of Hong Kong that suggests just how severe an effect the reduction of a significant tax break for electric vehicles has had on Tesla. The tax break had dropped the cost of a Model S 60 to a roughly $73,000 price tag; under the new tax rules, it costs about $118,000, per Quartz, which notes that elevated price is basically the same as buying a new Mercedes-Benz there. March was the last month where the electric vehicles were available at the lower effective price. Newly purchased Teslas registered by first-time electric vehicle owners that month: 2,939. And in April: zero. And then in May: five. Tesla said in a statement that its ""business does not rely on"" favorable government policies, though its securities filings note it is not immune to the effects of changing such incentives. The Journal notes Tesla is working to get its vehicles into China, citing one gloomy quote on the subject from an analyst: ""Hong Kong is the fashionable China. It's not exactly painting a glowing picture for the future of Tesla in China."""

We're told Simpson was nice to responding security guards. Still, we're told he's been permanently banned from the Cosmopolitan.  OJ Simpson has been issued a trespass notice at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas after he was seen there Wednesday night.Details on what, exactly, occurred at the hotel while Simpson was present were scarce, but Simpson's attorney Malcolm Laverne, issued a statement confirming that the former athlete was banned.""Cosmopolitan exercised its right to issue a trespass notice. Any private property in Nevada has the right to tell any person that you are trespassing and please don't come back if you comeback you are subject to a misdemeanor arrest,"" Laverne said.Las Vegas police said they were not involved in any investigation into an incident at the hotel involving Simpson, since it is considered a ""private property issue.""A patron at the hotel's bar told ABC News that Simpson arrived around 10:40 p.m. About 10 minutes later, the patron snapped a photo with Simpson.According to the witness account, others in Simpson's party drank wine, but Simpson himself abstained. Simpson stayed sitting at his table for the duration of the time he was at the bar, the witness said. He left around midnight.Laverne maintains that Simpson was not drunk and did not became belligerent, contrary to some media reports.There were no broken glasses or yelling at staff, Laverne said, reiterating that there is no video of any such behavior.Simpson's parole conditions allow him to consume alcohol, but not in excess.  O.J. Simpson was reportedly removed from a Las Vegas casino early Thursday morning for unruly behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson's lawyer, Malcolm LaVergne, said the Simpson was banned from The Cosmopolitan hotel, according to The Associated Press. LaVergne said no reason was given for the ban. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But LaVergne said that the story about Simpson being drunk at The Cosmopolitan is completely untrue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaVergne says that Simpson is a social drinker, meaning he usually orders one drink and sips on it while socializing, and that he was at the Cosmopolitan to eat chicken wings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaVergne also said that the hotel-casino had apparently decided before Simpson's visit to trespass him from the property. LaVergne says that after Simpson was notified, he left the hotel-casino quietly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, Simpson is challenging anyone with proof that he was drunk and belligerent to come forward. He is also taking steps to make sure that his probation officer is clear about what happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosmopolitan still has not issued a statement in regards to the incident. LaVergne pointed out several times that the hotel-casino has the right to ban anyone they want for any reason. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TMZ reports that Las Vegas police were contacted just after midnight on Thursday about an a drunk and disorderly guest at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Simpson reportedly was upset with hotel staff and broke glasses during the dispute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to audio published by TMZ, a dispatcher mentions that ""Orenthal is here"" at Clique, a club inside the Cosmopolitan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are no reports of Simpson being arrested following the incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson was released from prison last month after serving 10 years for kidnapping and burglary charges. As part of his parole, Simpson is allowed to consume alcohol, but not to excess — meaning he cannot test higher than .08 on a blood-alcohol level.","OJ Simpson has been out of prison for more than a month, and he's not exactly being a model parolee, according to TMZ. Sources tell the website that Simpson was chucked out of the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas for being drunk and belligerent. According to TMZ's sources, Simpson "" was angry at hotel staff and glasses broke at the bar,"" though he behaved himself when security arrived to escort him out. Simpson is now apparently permanently banned from the hotel, though his lawyer, Malcolm LaVergne, says it was nothing to do with his client's behavior. He claims the hotel decided to ban Simpson even before he arrived. ""Cosmopolitan exercised its right to issue a trespass notice,"" LaVergne said in a statement. ""Any private property in Nevada has the right to tell any person that you are trespassing and please don’t come back; if you come back you are subject to a misdemeanor arrest."" If Simpson was drunk, he could be in violation of parole terms, the Washington Post reports, though a witness tells KABC that Simpson abstained while other members of his party drank wine.

"A pill that helps people cut down on alcohol will be available to people who drink at least half a bottle of wine or three pints a night from today. Experts say the drug reduces the urge to drink and can be prescribed alongside counselling support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has published formal guidance recommending nalmefene, following draft guidance released in October, which means that patients have the right to request the drug if they meet certain requirements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nalmefene, also called Selincro, is suitable for anyone who regularly drinks high amounts of alcohol, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as 7.5 units a day for men and five units a day for women. It helps patients gradually cut back on their alcohol intake and is therefore not suitable for anyone with a severe alcohol problem who needs to stop immediately. The pill costs £3, can be taken up to once a day, and is designed to be used whenever the patient wants to stave off the desire to drink. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lyndsey Dudley, a spokeswoman for Nice, said the drug would be suitable for people who “probably don’t even recognise themselves as an alcoholic”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said: “It is much like a patch that you might wear to give up smoking, to support you to cut down on your alcohol intake. Some days you might feel stronger than others.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than two million Britons are believed to be mildly dependent on alcohol. Thirty-five thousand people are expected to be given nalmefene as part of treatment for alcohol dependency in the first year. However, the actual figure might prove to be lower. Data released yesterday for Scotland, where nalmefene was approved for use in October last year, show that only 53 people were prescribed the drug in 2013/14. The 35,000 figure is based on the prediction that 58,000 people are expected to receive psychosocial intervention for mild alcohol dependency, of whom 60% will be given nalmefene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dudley said the figure may change as “people might not want to go down the medication route straight away”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Information given by the drug’s manufacturer Lundbeck identifies fictional examples of the sort of people eligible for nalmefene, including Sue, 39, who “looks forward to a glass of wine after work when the kids go to bed but always finishes the bottle while cooking and eating with her husband, and opens a second bottle a few days each week”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Carole Longson, Nice’s health technology evaluation centre director, said: “Many people have a difficult relationship with alcohol even though they have a very stable lifestyle, maintain jobs and a social life and would not automatically assume they have a problem. But regularly drinking over the recommended daily amount of alcohol can seriously damage your health. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services and taking part in therapy programmes. We are pleased to be able to recommend the use of namelfene to support people further in their efforts to fight alcohol dependence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When used alongside psychosocial support nalmefene is clinically and cost effective for the NHS compared with psychosocial support alone.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Jonathan Chick, a medical adviser for Drinkaware, said: “Two glasses of wine per day is not by any definition ‘mild alcoholism’. Nalmefene is for people who are concerned about their drinking, have tried to cut down, have been given brief advice/counselling by their doctor and are still regularly drinking more than low-risk levels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The risks start at 14 units per week for women and 21 for men, but patients who will be prescribed nalmefene will be drinking higher amounts than that, and will have provoked changes in their brain patterns which have led to difficulty controlling their drinking.”  Middle-class drinkers in Britain who enjoy having more than three glasses of wine a night, will be given a pill to reduce their dependency on alcohol. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has approved the use of Nalmefene, also called Selincro, to curb men and women drinking more than the required 7.5 units and 5 units a day limit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The institute said the drug has been approved for use alongside counselling support for people, who want to reduce their alcohol intake by up to 1.8 units a day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nalmefene is available from today and costs £42.42 for a 14-tablet pack, or about £3 a day. Around 35,000 people are expected to be given Nalmefene in the first year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Carole Longson, director from NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: ""Many people have a difficult relationship with alcohol even though they have a very stable lifestyle, maintain jobs and a social life and would not automatically assume they have a problem. But regularly drinking over the recommend daily amount of alcohol can seriously damage your health. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services and taking part in therapy programmes. We are pleased to be able to recommend the use of namelfene to support people further in their efforts to fight alcohol dependence,"" she said.","Those Brits who want to cut down on their alcohol intake—and can spare about $5 a day—now have access to a pill to reduce their craving. UK officials have approved the drug nalmefene for use along with counseling to help reduce alcohol dependency, the International Business Times reports. The official approval means people who fit the right profile can request the prescription drug. ""Those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services, and taking part in therapy programs,"" says a researcher. Nalmefene, which can be taken once a day, helps people feel less of an urge to drink, experts say. It's considered appropriate for many people drinking the equivalent of at least half a bottle of wine daily, the Guardian reports. Plenty of potential candidates to take the drug ""probably don’t even recognize themselves as an alcoholic,"" says a health official, who compares it to a nicotine patch. But since nalmefene is intended to be used to gradually reduce alcohol intake, it's not a good solution for people who need to quit right away, the Guardian notes."
"Ready for your first look at David Letterman’s new talk show? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Above is the first teaser trailer for the series, titled My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That title suggests a show that’s setting a high bar for booking celebrities with name recognization and Letterman’s first guest certainly qualifies: The show will launch with the first post-presidency TV talk show interview with Barack Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the hour-long premiere will have two firsts: The former CBS Late Show host emerging from retirement and the former president giving his first on-camera talk-show chat of the Trump era. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show will launch Friday, Jan. 12 and a new episode will be stream each subsequent month in 2018 — so the Letterman series is rather unique in the Netflix universe as it has a rather anti-binge roll-out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Letterman’s lineup of influential guests includes George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai, JAY-Z, Tina Fey, and Howard Stern. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Netflix, the “interviews will take place both inside and outside a studio setting. The conversations are intimate, in-depth and far-reaching, with the levity and humor Dave’s fans know and love. Field segments will bring Letterman to locations far and wide, expressing his curiosity and desire to dig deeper on a specific topic related to the iconic guest featured in the episode.”  David Letterman has amassed an all-star roster of guests for his upcoming Netflix talk show series, which is titled My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 60-minute show will stream monthly with the first episode launching on Friday, Jan. 12, and the additional five episodes streaming, one a month, after that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Letterman will kick off the series with a chat with Barack Obama, with the interview serving as the former president's first talk-show appearance since leaving office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other guests set for Letterman's series include George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai, Jay-Z, Tina Fey and Howard Stern. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The project, produced by RadicalMedia and Letterman's Worldwide Pants, marks the longtime Late Show host's first regular return to the small screen since leaving the CBS show in May 2015. He previously made a one-episode appearance on National Geographic's Years of Living Dangerously documentary series. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each episode will be centered around one person Letterman finds fascinating, with the two engaging in in-depth conversations both inside and outside a studio setting. The show will also feature field segments with Letterman embarking on trips related to the guest featured on each episode. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Letterman previously told The Hollywood Reporter that he wanted to interview North Korea leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump on his Netflix series. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former CBS host has made no secret of his desire to interview Trump and call the former Apprentice host out on some of his more radical statements and actions since he entered politics. But the president has kept a low-profile on the talk-show circuit, not sitting down for any of the high-profile late-night shows, all of which have taken aim at him, since taking office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I think I have insight now that heretofore I did not have,"" Letterman told THR of why he wants to talk to Trump. ""I'm tired of people saying, 'Can you believe he…' and 'Oh, my God, what has he done… .' I want to put an end to that. ... What we need now is somebody like myself to sit down with him and calmly get him to sign some papers and then have him leave the White House."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With respect to Kim Jong-un, Letterman said he wonders, ""What does he want? They have a missile they think can hit Chicago — what's he pissed off at Chicago about? Are we at war with this guy? We put sanctions on him, he gets more pissed off. If Dennis Rodman goes over there, I ought to be over there. … I wouldn’t want to make it worse, but on the other hand, I don't know that you can make it worse. OK, you're building rockets, you've got nuclear capabilities, OK, great. What, really, does that help?!"" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added, ""I don't know that he'd be the prototypical guest but, by God, wouldn't you like an hour to just look at this guy and talk to him and listen to him? Does he have kids? Does he have pets? Why does he want to behave like this? If he wants to be a hero, why not start trying to reunite the peninsula? Why not do something that has some humanity to it? I don't get this."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for the tone of the show, Letterman predicted that ""there will be some silliness regardless"" of who he's interviewing or the topic of a field piece. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I'm of the opinion that irrespective of the topic and regardless of who you're talking with — I just think if you go to dinner with Person A or Person B, sooner or later there's going to be something funny that happens or is said that is either in context of a greater topic or adjunct to a greater topic,"" he said. ""I don't have a news background or a journalism background, but I have to believe there will be some silliness regardless. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's the nice thing — we'll find out."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Netflix also released the below trailer for Letterman's series.","Handsome Santa Claus and one-time Late Show host David Letterman has a new talk show on Netflix, and his first guest truly needs no introduction. The Hollywood Reporter reveals the first guest on My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman will be none other than Barack Obama. The episode, which hits Netflix Jan. 12, is notable for two reasons: It will be Obama's first talk show appearance since becoming a former president, and it marks Letterman's first return to a regular TV gig since leaving The Late Show in 2015. EW.com quotes Netflix on My Next Guest Needs No Introduction: ""The conversations are intimate, in-depth, and far-reaching, with the levity and humor Dave’s fans know and love.""

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move suggests that even as Mr. Weiner vows to press ahead with his candidacy, there are mounting doubts about its political viability within his own campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Weiner’s staff was jolted by his admission last week that his habit of sending raunchy online photographs and messages to women had persisted long after he resigned from Congress in 2011. The disclosures clashed with Mr. Weiner’s claims that he had been rehabilitated after undergoing therapy and his suggestion that such behavior had long ago stopped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Kedem had helped guide Mr. Weiner’s candidacy, originally considered a long shot, to the top of the polls in the mayoral field before last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not long ago, Mr. Kedem made clear he had no qualms about his new job. He sent an e-mail to dozens of his associates in late June seeking volunteers and financial contributions for Mr. Weiner’s mayoral bid. “I am really proud to work for Anthony,” he wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His departure is a hit to a campaign that was short of experienced staff members, because of Mr. Weiner’s scandal and his reputation as a difficult boss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Sunday, Mr. Weiner insisted that “we have an excellent staff,” and that volunteers were still flocking to his campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before working for Mr. Weiner, Mr. Kedem had managed the re-election of John DeStefano Jr. to a 10th term as mayor of New Haven in 2011, according to his online profile, and worked on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Video  Anthony Weiner needs to ""go away"" and will not be the next mayor of New York City, Democratic strategist David Axelrod said Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Voters don't need to hear any more from Weiner over his explicit, online relationships with women, said President Barack Obama's longtime political counselor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""At this point it's absurd. He is not going to be the next mayor of New York. He is wasting time and space,"" Axelrod said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former Democratic congressman from New York, now running for New York City mayor, was plunged back in scandal last week over revelations that he continued sending inappropriate messages online after leaving Congress. Axelrod said enough is enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""It's time for him to go away and let New York have its mayor's race,"" Axelrod said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read more about: David Axelrod, Anthony Weiner, Meet The Press, New York City  Rep. Peter King said Sunday Anthony Weiner should step out of the New York City mayoral race, saying he has a “pathological problem.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He should do himself and everybody a favor and step to the sidelines. He is not psychologically qualified to be mayor of the city of New York,” the Republican congressman from New York said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR King said the fact Weiner is still pulling top poll numbers is a “terrible aberration” and that there was never a way Weiner could have won the race even before the recent revelations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I just think it was sort of a perverse celebrity factor for a while to have his numbers up there,"" King said. ""I just can't see any way, even if this latest scandal would not have come out, that Anthony Weiner could have won."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read more about: Anthony Weiner, Peter King","Huma Abedin is thus far still standing behind her man, but the guy running Anthony Weiner's campaign for New York City mayor is not. Weiner's 31-year-old campaign manager, Danny Kedem, has quit, reports the New York Times, in the latest tire to blow out for an increasingly battered and bare-bones campaign. Weiner confirmed Kedem's departure this morning, noting, “Danny has left the campaign. He did a remarkable job."" Kedem put his long-shot candidate atop the polls—before the latest round of sexting emerged. It's not the only blow for Weiner today, as top politicians raced to the Sunday shows to throw Weiner under the bus. A sampling: David Axelrod, as per Politico: ""At this point it's absurd. He is not going to be the next mayor of New York. He is wasting time and space. It's time for him to go away and let New York have its mayor's race."" Peter King: ""He should do himself and everybody a favor and step to the sidelines. He is not psychologically qualified to be mayor of the city of New York. I just can't see any way, even if this latest scandal would not have come out, that Anthony Weiner could have won."" Mayoral rival Christine Quinn: ""When you see scandal after scandal about this, what it does is create even more distrust and maybe even disgust in government. We really need to move beyond that."" And further: ""Has he disqualified himself? Yes. He disqualified himself, but not just because of these scandals. He didn't have the qualifications when he was in Congress. He was in Congress for 12 years, he passed one bill."" Former Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Myers: The Clintons ""would like to see this go away. It's very painful for the Clintons. They are genuinely very close to Huma."" And it's all over but the singing anyway: “He may still be in the race, but his campaign is over. Voters are willing to forgive people as long as the person is genuinely sorry and tries to change. Anthony Weiner's played voters for fools.”"
"Lie detector tests could be used regularly on 'high risk' sex offenders NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Compulsory lie detector tests are set be introduced to monitor convicted sex offenders under a change to the law due to be approved later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MPs will debate the relevant legislation in the House of Commons and are expected to approve routine use of polygraph screening for the most serious offenders across England and Wales from next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If convicted rapists or other dangerous sex attackers are found to have lied about crucial matters or breached the terms of their licence after being released from jail they could be sent back to prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Minister Jeremy Wright issued a statement saying: ""Introducing lie detector tests, alongside the sex offenders register and close monitoring in the community, will give us one of the toughest approaches in the world to managing this group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We recently announced the creation of a new National Probation Service tasked with protecting the public from the most high-risk offenders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""They will be able to call on this technology to help stop sex offenders from reoffending and leaving more innocent victims in their wake."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Government aims to roll out the tests next spring, subject to the parliamentary timetable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move follows a successful pilot scheme in the Midlands. Trials in two areas found the tests made sex criminals more open with probation officers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Polygraph tests measure blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and levels of perspiration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These vital signs display subtle changes when someone is deliberately evasive and polygraph experts can usually determine if that person is lying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Studies have shown that polygraphs are accurate around 85% of the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The method is widely used in the US, with 19 states using lie detector tests in criminal cases, including during court testimonies.  MPs are expected to clear the way for the introduction of compulsory lie detector tests to monitor convicted sex offenders across England and Wales from next January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The national rollout of US-style mandatory polygraph tests for serious sex offenders who have been released into the community after serving their prison sentence follows a successful pilot scheme. The trial was carried out from 2009-11 in two Midlands probation areas and found that offenders taking such tests were twice as likely to tell probation staff they had contacted a victim, entered an exclusion zone or otherwise breached terms of their release licence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Continuing concerns about the reliability of the tests and misinterpretation of the results mean they still cannot be used in any court in England and Wales. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it is expected that the compulsory polygraph tests will be used to monitor the behaviour of 750 of the most serious sex offenders, all of whom have been released into the community after serving a sentence of at least 12 months in jail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tests involve measuring reactions to specific questions by monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and levels of perspiration to assess whether the subject is being truthful. The results will be used to determine whether they have breached the terms of their release licence or represent a risk to public safety and should be recalled to prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The power to introduce compulsory lie detector tests was put on the statute book six years ago in the Offender Management Act 2007. On Tuesday MPs will debate secondary legislation in the form of a statutory instrument to come into force from 6 January 2014. The House of Lords will be asked to approve it later this month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The justice minister Jeremy Wright said: ""Introducing lie detector tests, alongside the sex offenders register and close monitoring in the community, will give us one of the toughest approaches in the world to managing this group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We recently announced the creation of a National Probation Service tasked with protecting the public from the most high-risk offenders. They will be able to call on this technology to help stop sex offenders from reoffending and leaving more innocent victims in their wake."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hertfordshire police used the tests in a pilot scheme in 2011 to help decide whether to charge suspected sex offenders and gauge the risk they posed to the public. ""Low level"" sex offenders were involved in the original pilot. At least six revealed more serious offending and were found to pose a more serious risk to children than previously estimated. A further trial was ordered but at the time the Association of Chief Police Officers voiced caution about the adoption of such tests: ""Polygraph techniques are complex and are by no means a single solution to solving crimes, potentially offering in certain circumstances an additional tool to structured interrogation,"" a spokesman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Polygraph testing is used in court in 19 states in America, subject to the discretion of the trial judge, but it is widely used by prosecutors, defence lawyers and law enforcement agencies across the US.","Serious sex offenders in the UK will soon be forced to take routine lie detector tests after being released from prison, Sky News reports. The new legislation is expected to be approved shortly and implemented next year. Though the polygraph test results won't be admissible in court, officials expect they'll help reveal probation violations that could land offenders back in jail. While the test could point out those who may be lying about their activities, there's also a big chance it'll spur them to own up to such behavior, per the Guardian. The paper reports that a three-year trial program found that offenders who took polygraphs were twice as likely to cop to prohibited behavior like communicating with a victim. ""Introducing lie detector tests, alongside the sex offenders register and close monitoring in the community, will give us one of the toughest approaches in the world to managing this group,"" says a Justice Minister in a statement, adding that the new approach will ""help stop sex offenders from reoffending and leaving more innocent victims in their wake."""

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""They were not answering their mobile phones, but we just thought it was because they were in a remote place,"" said family member Jose Ruiz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We started to look for them, and we found their cars open and empty, and neither they nor their instruments were at the farm where they were scheduled to play."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police confirmed that the band has not been seen or heard from since Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A number of musicians have been kidnapped and murdered by drug gangs in Mexico over the last few years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2007 Sergio Gomez, singer in the band K-Pax, was kidnapped and strangled to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hours after denying reports of his murder, Sergio Vega, known as El Shaka, was shot dead while driving his red Cadillac. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of those murdered were narcocorridos, who sing songs celebrating the lives of drug barons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among them is Diego Rivas, who was shot dead in 2011 after composing a song in praise of Joaquin Shorty Guzman, Mexico's most wanted drug baron. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The missing band play Colombian music, not usually linked to drug gangs, but local media report that the venue of the band's last gig does have links to drug violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year conductor and pianist Rodolfo Cazares, music director of the Bremerhaven City Theatre in Germany, was kidnapped while visiting relatives in Mexico. He has not been seen since. Fears are growing that he may have been murdered by a drug gang. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year more than 70,000 people died in drug-related violence in Mexico, prompting President Enrique Pena Nieto, who was sworn in last December, to set-up a new national police force to tackle organised crime.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 20 people include 15 members of Kombo Kolombia and the band's crew.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Relatives filed an official report about their missing loved ones on Friday, after they lost cellular telephone contact with them following the Thursday night performance. When family members went to the bar to investigate, they found the band members' vehicles still parked outside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For three years, Kombo Kolombia has played a Colombian style of music known as vallenato, which is popular in Nuevo Leon state. Most of the group's musicians were from the area, and have held large concerts in addition to bar performances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nuevo Leon state officials said one of those missing is a Colombian citizen with Mexican residency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of other musical bands, usually groups that performed ""narcocorridos"" celebrating the exploits of drug traffickers, have been killed in Mexico in recent years. But Kombo Kolombia did not play that type of music and its lyrics did not deal with violence or drug trafficking.","Members of a Colombian-style band who disappeared after a gig in northern Mexico last week have become the latest musicians to be kidnapped and murdered by drug gangs, authorities fear. The 16-man Kombo Kolombia band and four of its roadies were reported missing early Friday; investigators have now discovered at least eight bodies dumped in a well in the area, the AP reports. The band members were Mexican but played Colombian-style vallenato music, which is not normally associated with drug gangs, the International Business Times reports. After the band played a private show in a bar north of Monterrey last Thursday night, people reported hearing gunshots and vehicles speeding away. The band members' empty vehicles were found outside the bar."

"Photo by Feng Li/Getty Images. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""I heard it and I felt it,"" American sprinter Manteo Mitchell told the Associated Press after breaking his leg on Thursday. Mitchell, who was halfway through his segment of the men’s 4-by-400 relay when he felt something snap, did what he said “almost any person would've done in that situation”—he finished the remaining 200 meters. His endurance wasn’t for naught: After Mitchell limped off, his three teammates completed the relay and qualified for the 4-by-400 final. After the race, doctors diagnosed Mitchell with a complete break of the left fibula and said the bone would heal in four to six weeks. How difficult is it to run 200 meters on a broken fibula? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Very difficult, but not impossible. The fibula is the smaller of the two bones that make up the lower leg, the other being the tibia. Unlike the tibia, the fibula is non-weight-bearing. As such, it is possible to run on a broken fibula. The pain, though, would be intense and would likely debilitate many athletes. The fact that Mitchell made it around the track in just more than 46 seconds—a time that placed him in a tie for fifth out of eight runners—is extremely impressive.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitchell broke a bone in his left leg, USA Track and Field said in a news release. The 25-year-old, running the leadoff leg, felt his fibula snap with 200 meters to go.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitchell's split was 46.1 and the Americans went on to finish in 2:58.87 to qualify for Friday's final. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitchell said on Monday he was going up a set of stairs, missed one and landed poorly.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Never thought that the phrase 'break a leg' would reach reality for me lol,"" he tweeted later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR USA Track and Field has not said who will take Mitchell's place on the team. Two other members of the relay team pool -- Jeremy Wariner and LaShawn Merritt -- have injured hamstrings and cannot run. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Americans will likely turn to one of their 400-meter hurdlers. Angelo Taylor, who was fifth in the 400 hurdles, ran in the 4x400-meter relay final at the world championships last year. Kerron Clement ran for the U.S. at the Beijing Games. But that was in a qualifying race while Taylor ran in the final, winning gold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bolt makes history","The US made it to the men's 4x400-meter relay finals with the help of a runner who deserves a gold medal for pain endurance. Manteo Mitchell was 200 meters into the race's first leg when a bone in his leg snapped. He managed to finish the rest of the lap in excruciating pain, and keep the US in the competition, CNN reports. After he limped off, an X-ray confirmed that the 25-year-old athlete had a broken left fibula, the smaller of the two leg bones. It is possible to run with a broken fibula, but most people would find the pain unbearable, Slate notes. Mitchell originally hurt himself missing a step as he went up some stairs at the Olympic Village earlier in the week, but he says he felt fine after treatment. But ""as soon as I took the first step past the 200-meter mark, I felt it break. I heard it,"" he says. ""I even put out a little war cry, but the crowd was so loud you couldn't hear it.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 55-year-old woman had been undergoing the controversial treatment once a month for two years when she suddenly developed a severe reaction, according to a report by Spanish doctors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She “developed wheezing, dyspnea, and sudden loss of consciousness immediately after a live bee sting,” the report, published in the latest issue of the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology, said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 2015 case is believed to be the first reported death from live bee acupuncture - also known as bee venom apitherapy - of a patient who had previously not been allergic.

Now a report published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology reveals what's believed to be the first death related to bee-sting therapy—aka live bee acupuncture, aka bee venom apitherapy—in someone who had previously shown tolerance for the treatment. In the case from 2015, a 55-year-old Spanish woman died of multiple organ failure after two years of the treatment to relieve muscular contracture and stress. In bee-sting therapy, bees placed on a patient's body have their heads squeezed until they extend their stingers, the Telegraph reports. The idea is that the stings cause inflammation and lead to an anti-inflammatory response from the body. The unnamed woman started wheezing and having shortness of breath during one of her monthly treatments at a private clinic before losing consciousness. She died weeks later at the hospital. Researchers say severe anaphylactic shock caused a ""massive watershed stroke and permanent coma,"" as well as the multiple organ failure. ""The risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable,"" one researcher says.

"ENLARGE Photo: Twitter NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bloomingdale’s, the luxury department store owned by Macy’s Inc., M 0.79 % is the latest advertiser to face an outpouring of criticism on the Web. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consumers have taken to social media this week to criticize an ad in Bloomingdale’s holiday catalog that some interpreted as encouraging date rape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ad features a woman laughing with her head turned as a young man looks her way. The text reads: “Spike Your Best Friend’s Eggnog When They’re Not Looking.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There have been 3,868 comments on social media channels over the last 48 hours about the ad, according to data from social media analytics firm Networked Insights. The majority of the comments, Networked Insights said, are negative. Data shows that many of the online commentators have called the ad “creepy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bloomingdale’s has apologized for the ad. “In reflection of recent feedback, the copy we used in our current catalog was inappropriate and in poor taste. Bloomingdale’s sincerely apologizes for this error in judgment,” said the company in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s unclear what the intention of the ad was, but branding experts say that marketers are under pressure to stand out amid the ever-increasing amount of advertising messages that consumers are being bombarded with every day. And even more is at stake heading into the all-important holiday shopping season. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Marketers have to work harder to get attention nowadays, but the more they try, the riskier it becomes,” said Jonah Disend, chief executive officer of Redscout, a branding firm owned by MDC Partners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bloomingdale’s is the latest company to see how quickly controversy can spread thanks in part to social media. Earlier this week, consumers took to social media to complain about Starbuck’s new red holiday cups or to vent about the fact there was even a controversy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com","""Bloomingdale's must be pleased everyone is too distracted by red cups to notice its pro-roofie holiday ad,"" tweets one Washington Post writer. That's right, another company has found itself in some holiday hot water this week. The Wall Street Journal reports the Internet is in an uproar over an ad in the Bloomingdale's holiday catalog that appears to encourage date rape. The offending ad shows a laughing woman looking away as a man stares intently at her. The text reads: ""Spike Your Best Friend's Eggnog When They're Not Looking."" A social analytics firm found thousands of online comments made about the ad, mostly negative with the majority opinion apparently being ""creepy."" ""Someone at Bloomingdale’s thought this ad was smart,"" a Mashable executive tweets. ""I assume that person has been fired."" But it's not just the Internet that has a problem with Bloomingdale's ad. ""What is this? Some kind of business function they’re attending? This is the way we’re going to treat women in the workplace?” a gender studies professor tells the Post. “It’s sending the message that it is it okay to have sex with people who are incapable of consent."" ""I doubt the person who created this was consciously thinking about sexual assault,"" another expert says. ""Male or female, whoever it was who came up with this—and the many people who okayed it—just don't get it."" Bloomingdale's apologized for the ad in the wake of the uproar. “In reflection of recent feedback, the copy we used in our current catalog was inappropriate and in poor taste,"" the Journal quotes a company statement.

"A service dog who attends school with her owner in Louisiana is getting plenty of attention online after the boy's school included the female golden doodle in its yearbook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph ""Seph"" Ware, 14, of West Monroe, La., has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a diagnosis he was given at the age of 3. The genetic condition causes progressive muscle weakness and muscle wasting, with most patients confined to wheelchairs by the time they are teens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ware's service dog, Presley, has been with him for the past four years, including when Seph attends classes at Good Hope Middle School. When picture day came around, school officials decided to include Presley - who has a canine sibling named Elvis - in the yearbook with all the other students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seph's mother, Lori Ware, told AL.com on Wednesday that her son's reaction was, ""Why not,"" when school officials asked his permission to include Presley in the yearbook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Seph says that it took about 10 minutes to get Presley to look at the camera - and who knows how many shots,"" Ware said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ware said she thinks the administrators' gesture was a great one since, in the past, Presley has not been welcomed as openly at school. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We have had issues with his elementary school accepting Presley, so to come to Good Hope and her to be welcomed has been very refreshing,"" Ware said. ""The kids adore her and she loves the attention."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The administrators' gesture has also gained traction on social media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A recent story in the News-Star, Monroe's local newspaper, highlighted the work that Presley does for Ware. The 5-year-old Presley and her canine sibling, Elvis, reunited last month for a visit after years apart. Elvis lives and works as a service dog in Wisconsin, also for a young boy with muscular dystrophy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both dogs help their young owners by doing things for them that their weakened muscles no longer allow, like picking up things they drop, hitting light switches and opening drawers, the news story reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Duchenne muscular dystrophy, one of nine types of the disease, is caused by a missing protein that, in most people, helps keep muscle cells intact. According to the Muscular Dystrophy Association, it affects primarily boys. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Besides the muscle deterioration leading to physical impairment, the disease also affects the heart and respiratory muscles. Advances in cardiac and respiratory care in recent years has expanded patients' life spans, making survival into their 30s more common. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are also cases of those affected living into their 40s and 50s, the MDA reports.  Among all the headshots of smiling students in a Louisiana middle school’s new yearbook, one photo clearly sticks out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It shows Presley, a service dog, and the photo in West Monroe’s Good Hope Middle School yearbook has been drawing a lot of attention since it started bouncing around the internet last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 5-year-old golden doodle shows up in the yearbook next to her owner Joseph “Seph” Ware, a 14-year-old Good Hope seventh-grader diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The student relies on Presley to help him get around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re kind of stunned at all the attention,” the boy’s mom, Lori Ware, told FoxNews.com Friday. “It’s humbling. I’m glad Presley is making the world happy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ware, 52, said her son has been drawing a paw print when classmates ask him to sign their yearbooks on behalf of Presley. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He’s loving it,” she said of her son. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Presley has been at Seph’s side since she was a small puppy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When picture day came around, school officials wanted to include the dog in the yearbook with the other students, Al.com reported this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ware said her son's response was, “why not.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Seph says that it took about 10 minutes to get Presley to look at the camera - and who knows how many shots,” she told Al.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness, AL.com reported. People diagnosed with the condition are usually confined to a wheelchair by the time they are teens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Good Hope students love having Presley around, Ware said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They aren’t supposed to pet her, but they sneak pets in the hallways after classes,” she told FoxNews.com. “And if Presley hears someone say, ‘Oh, look at the pretty puppy,' she perks right up because she knows she’s pretty.”","The cutest yearbook photo ever was just taken by Presley at Good Hope Middle School in Louisiana. In fairness to everyone else's not-quite-as-cute yearbook photos, Presley is a 5-year-old golden doodle. She's also a service dog for seventh-grader Joseph ""Seph"" Ware, who was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy when he was 3 years old, Al.com reports. Presley has been attending class with Seph for a few years, so it only seemed right for the school to give the dog her own yearbook photo, right next to Seph's. ""Seph says that it took about 10 minutes to get Presley to look at the camera—and who knows how many shots,"" his mother, Lori Watkins-Ware says. Presley's yearbook photo went viral, and Ware says Seph is his having his ""15 minutes of fame,"" Good Morning America reports. Though she tells Fox News her family can't believe all the attention the photo is getting. “It’s humbling,"" Ware says. ""I’m glad Presley is making the world happy.” Presley helps Seph with everything from turning on light switches to opening doors. Now Seph is returning the favor. Ware says other students have been asking Presley to sign their yearbooks, so Seph helpfully draws a paw print for her."

"MILWAUKEE (AP) — A convicted killer who is the subject of the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer"" filed a wide-ranging appeal claiming authorities used an improper warrant and that a juror was out to get him, among other things. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FILE - In this March 13, 2007 file photo, Steven Avery listens to testimony in the courtroom at the Calumet County Courthouse in Chilton, Wis. Avery, a convicted killer who is the subject of the Netflix... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steven Avery, who's seeking to be released on bond, was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach a decade ago. Avery had been wrongfully convicted years earlier in a rape case and served 18 years in prison. He had sued Manitowoc County for tens of millions before he and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, were arrested in Halbach's death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The appeal, filed Monday in an appeals court in Madison, bears Avery's signature and contains numerous spelling and grammar errors. His new attorney's name doesn't appear on it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Manitowoc County Sheriff Robert Hermann said Tuesday he hasn't seen the appeal, but he has said in the past that the investigation was proper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The filmmakers behind ""Making a Murder"" cast doubt on the legal process used to convict Avery and Dassey, and their work has sparked national interest and conjecture. Armchair investigators have flooded Twitter and message boards, and key players in the case have appeared on national news and talk shows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities involved in the case have called the 10-hour series biased. Filmmakers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, meanwhile, have stood by their work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Avery's new attorney, Kathleen Zellner, wasn't immediately available for comment Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the filing, Avery takes issue with a search conducted during the murder investigation, saying it improperly included multiple properties and therefore any evidence that was uncovered ""is clearly 'FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE.'"" The appeal also says that a juror tainted other jurors ""THROUGH DIRECT OR INDIRECT IN FLUENCE,"" stating numerous times that Avery ""IS F------ GUILTY."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said Judge Angela W. Sutkiewicz made misleading statements and that his lawyers were ineffective.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steven Avery, the convicted killer featured in Netflix's ""Making a Murderer,"" won't be pardoned if Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has anything to do about it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tens of thousands of people have signed petitions for Avery to be exonerated in the October 2005 killing of Teresa Halbach after the documentary suggested that Avery might have been a stooge for a conspiracy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Avery, 53, insists he didn't kill Halbach, a 25-year-old freelance photographer. He is serving life in prison for murder, and Brendan Dassey, his nephew, who was a teenager at the time of the killing, is serving life as an accessory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House has previously pointed out that President Barack Obama can't pardon Avery because he wasn't convicted of a federal crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: 'Making a Murderer' Inspires Pardon Petitions for Steven Avery NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Monday, Walker — a tough-on-crime Republican who has never issued a pardon during his five years in office — indicated in a statement posted to social media that he wouldn't start with Avery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statement links to an August 2011 decision by a three-judge panel of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. The judges upheld Avery's conviction, ruling that the removal of a juror from his trial and the introduction of key evidence found in his home were proper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kathleen Zellner, an Illinois lawyer who specializes in seeking reversals of convictions, took over last week as head of Avery's defense. She said in a statement that the defense has uncovered new evidence that will exonerate Avery — but she didn't say what it was.","Steven Avery has filed a fresh appeal in his Wisconsin murder case—and thanks to the hit Netflix documentary Making a Murderer, there are now a lot more people paying attention. The appeal filed in a Madison court on Monday, which can be seen in full here, accuses authorities of searching his property illegally and claims that a juror with a preconceived notion that he was guilty improperly influenced other jurors during his 2007 trial for the murder of Teresa Halbach, the AP reports. Avery recently secured new legal representation from Chicago-area lawyer Kathleen Zellner and the Midwest Innocence Project, reports WBAY, but Monday's court filing appears to have been prepared without the new legal team. Zellner specializes in reversing convictions, and she says she has found new evidence that will exonerate Avery, reports NBC News. The Netflix documentary suggests that Avery—who served 18 years for a rape he didn't commit before being released two years before the Halbach murder—is the victim of a conspiracy, and a petition urging President Obama and Gov. Scott Walker to free him now has more than 415,000 signatures. Walker, however, has never pardoned anybody, and WBAY reports that he has signaled he isn't going to start with Avery. Netflix viewers ""should read the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeals before jumping to conclusions,"" he said in a Facebook post."

But instead of his wife showing up at the South Buckeye Equestrian Center, the cops did—and hauled him into a Maricopa County jail on child endangerment and abuse charges for allegedly leaving his 5-year-old granddaughter alone in the desert with a peculiar and perilous set of instructions. ""She was given [a] gun and told to shoot any bad guys,"" Sheriff Joe Arpaio tells Reuters. ""I don't know how a 5-year-old can tell a good guy from a bad guy, but that's what she said she was told."" Deputies say the girl had been reported missing about four hours after she went out Sunday afternoon with her grandpa in his pickup truck. It's unclear whether the truck broke down or somehow became stuck; Rater says he didn't have his cellphone on him, couldn't call for help, and started walking. The 53-year-old says his granddaughter started to complain she couldn't go further, so he left her under a tree with a .45-caliber handgun that was both loaded and cocked, per Reuters. An off-duty firefighter and the girl's grandmother found her during a frantic search; she was holding the weapon with ""one round in the chamber and the hammer locked back,"" per a police statement. Workers at the equestrian center (a bar/restaurant/feed store) say when Rater arrived he did gripe about having to walk out of the desert but made no reference to the girl. ""He came across multiple people and never thought he should call 911,"" deputies say in the statement. Bond for Rater was set at $25,000 on Monday, per KPHO. The girl has been returned to her mother, ABC15 notes. (Young children with guns almost never ends well.)"

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is recommending that six of 27 national monuments under review by the Trump administration be reduced in size, with changes to several others proposed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A leaked memo from Zinke to President Donald Trump recommends that two Utah monuments - Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante — be reduced, along with Nevada's Gold Butte and Oregon's Cascade-Siskiyou. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two marine monuments in the Pacific Ocean also would be reduced under Zinke's memo, which has not been officially released. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the memo, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump ordered the review earlier this year after complaining about improper ""land grabs"" by former presidents, including Barack Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR National monument designations add protections for lands revered for their natural beauty and historical significance with the goal of preserving them for future generations. The restrictions aren't as stringent as for national parks, but some policies include limits on mining, timber cutting and recreational activities such as riding off-road vehicles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The monuments under review were designated by four presidents over the last two decades. Several are about the size of the state of Delaware, including Mojave Trails in California, Grand-Staircase Escalante in Utah and Bears Ears, which is on sacred tribal land. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No other president has tried to eliminate a monument, but some have trimmed and redrawn boundaries 18 times, according to the National Park Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zinke told The Associated Press last month that unspecified boundary adjustments for some monuments designated over the past four decades will be included in the recommendations submitted to Trump. None of the sites would revert to new ownership, he said, while public access for uses such as hunting, fishing or grazing would be maintained or restored. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also spoke of protecting tribal interests and historical land grants, pointing to monuments in New Mexico, where Hispanic ranchers have opposed two monuments proclaimed by Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zinke declined to say whether portions of the monuments would be opened up to oil and gas drilling, mining, logging and other industries for which Trump has advocated. It was not clear from the memo how much energy development would be allowed on the sites recommended for changes, although the memo cites increased public access as a key goal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokeswoman for Zinke referred questions Sunday night to the White House, which did not offer immediate comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Trump adopts the recommendations, it would quiet some of the worst fears of his opponents, who warned that vast public lands and marine areas could be lost to states or private interests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But significant reductions in the size of the monuments, especially those created by Obama, would mark the latest in a string of actions where Trump has sought to erode his Democratic predecessor's legacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The recommendations cap an unprecedented four-month review based on Trump's claim that the century-old Antiquities Act had been misused by past presidents to create oversized monuments that hinder energy development, grazing and other uses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The review raised alarm among conservationists who said protections could be lost for areas that are home to ancient cliff dwellings, towering sequoia trees, deep canyons and ocean habitats. They've vowed to file lawsuits if Trump attempts any changes that would reduce the size of monuments or rescind their designations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zinke had previously announced that no changes would be made at six national monuments — in Montana, Colorado, Idaho, California, Arizona and Washington. He also said that Bears Ears monument in Utah should be downsized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to shrinking six monuments, Zinke recommends changes at several other sites, including two national monuments in New Mexico: Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and Rio Grande del Norte. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also recommended changes to Katahdin Woods and Waters in Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society, said the recommendations apparently made by Zinke ""represent an unprecedented assault on our parks and public lands"" by the Trump administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""This callous proposal will needlessly punish local, predominantly rural communities that depend on parks and public lands for outdoor recreation, sustainable jobs and economic growth,"" Williams said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We believe the Trump administration has no legal authority to alter or erase protections for national treasures. If President Trump acts in support of these recommendations, The Wilderness Society will move swiftly to challenge those actions in court,"" Williams said.","Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is recommending that six of 27 national monuments under review by the Trump administration be reduced in size, with changes to several others proposed, per the AP.

The changes also could open up areas around monuments on land to coal and oil exploration.

The Journal expects environmental groups to fight any changes."
"Babies cry more in Britain, Canada, Italy and Netherlands than in other countries – proved for first time by new research by the University of Warwick. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Psychologists have created world’s first universal charts for normal amount of crying in babies during first three months NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR in babies during first three months On average, babies around the world cry for around 2 hours per day in first two weeks, peak at 2 hours 15 mins at six weeks - and crying reduces to 1 hour 10 minutes by week twelve NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Denmark, Germany and Japan, parents deal with the least amount of crying and fussing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Babies cry more in Britain, Canada and Italy, than the rest of the world – according to new research by the University of Warwick. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Dieter Wolke in the Department of Psychology and the Warwick Medical School has formulated the world’s first universal charts for the normal amount of crying in babies during the first three months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a meta-analysis of studies involving almost 8700 infants – in countries including Germany, Denmark, Japan, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK – Professor Wolke calculated the average of how long babies fuss and cry per twenty-four hours across different cultures in their first twelve weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On average, it was found that babies cry for around two hours per day in the first two weeks. Crying generally peaks at around two hours fifteen minutes per day at six weeks – and reduces gradually to an average of 1 hour 10 minutes by the twelve week mark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, some infants were found to cry as little as 30 minutes - and others over 5 hours - in twenty-four hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Babies cry the most in the UK, Italy, Canada, and the Netherlands – and the lowest levels of crying were found in Denmark, Germany and Japan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The highest levels of colic – defined as crying more than 3 hours a day for at least 3 days a week in a baby– were found in the UK (28% of infants at 1-2 weeks), Canada (34.1% at 3-4 weeks of age) and Italy (20.9% at 8-9 weeks of age). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In contrast, lowest colic rates were reported in Denmark (5.5% at 3-4 weeks) and Germany (6.7% at 3-4 weeks). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The current definitions for determining whether a baby is crying too much and suffering from colic, are the Wessel criteria, which were formulated in the 1950s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As childcare and the family unit has largely transformed over the last half century and across different cultures, new universal guidelines were needed for modern parents and health professionals to assess normal and excessive levels of crying in babies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Wolke comments on what the research will lead to: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Babies are already very different in how much they cry in the first weeks of life – there are large but normal variations. We may learn more from looking at cultures where there is less crying and whether this may be due to parenting or other factors relating to pregnancy experiences or genetics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The new chart of normal fuss/cry amounts in babies across industrialised countries will help health professionals to reassure parents whether a baby is crying within the normal expected range in the first 3 months or shows excessive crying which may require further evaluation and extra support for the parents.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research, ‘Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: Fussing and Crying Durations and Colic Prevalence in Infants’ is published in The Journal of Pediatrics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3 April 2017  Professor Dieter Wolke, who led the research, said: “German and Danish parents are much less likely to get worked up and they will wait a little bit before they intervene to see if the baby can self-sooth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They don’t get all worried about it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across all the countries examined for the survey, babies cried for an average of two hours per day in the first two weeks after birth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crying peaked at about two hours and 15 minutes each day at six weeks of age, before gradually reducing to an average of one hour and 10 minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Previous research has indicated that around 40 per cent of infant crying is inconsolable, and Professor Wolke said many new mothers and fathers are unduly stressed by some “unscientific” parenting books which offer bogus solutions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Concern in Britain over crying babies costed the NHS an estimated £70 million each year, he said, with stressed-out parents less more likely to reinforce a pattern of crying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s the same principal as going on a plane,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You are told to put your own oxygen mask on before helping others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he added that adult well-being surveys consistently put Denmark as one of the happiest countries in the world and that Danish babies may enjoy some “genetic bias” whereby they cry less. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The new chart of normal fuss/cry amounts in babies across industrialised countries will help health care professions to reassure parents whether a baby is crying within the normal expected range in the first three months or shows excessive crying which may require further evaluation and extra support for the parents,” he said.","New research into the amount of time that infants in various countries spend crying found that the littlest ones in usually placid Canada were the most colicky. British babies came in second, followed by Italy. The most tranquil tots, meanwhile, live in Denmark and Germany. Writing in the Journal of Pediatrics, psychologists at the University of Warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic—a harmless, if nerve-jangling, condition—by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks. The longest crying jags were clocked in Canada, reports the Guardian, where 34.1% of babies wailed more than three hours a day, at least three days a week. In the UK, the tally was 28% and in Italy 20.9%. Relatively blissful Danish babes scored 5.5%, with Germany at 6.7%. The first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks, peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks. Happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere, crying time is halved by week 12, per a press release. Lead researcher Dieter Wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. ""They don’t get all worried about it,"" Wolke tells the Telegraph. Then again, he notes, Danish babies may enjoy a bit of ""genetic bias"" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys. In any case, new parents should learn to chill. ""If you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby,"" Wolke says. (Crying saved this baby's life.)"

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Marcus Stanley is no longer with this office,” Boxer spokesman Zachary Coile told POLITICO. “He submitted his resignation, and Sen. Boxer accepted it because his actions yesterday were wrong and unacceptable.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stanley has worked on Capitol Hill since 2007, according to financial disclosure records from Legistorm, and draws a six-figure salary. He has also worked for the Joint Economic Committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marijuana possession has been an ongoing issue on the Capitol grounds, especially since the Capitol Visitor Center opened with additional screening facilities. In the past year and a half, more than a dozen people have been stopped for bringing marijuana into the Capitol complex, along with other drugs, including at least one instance involving cocaine, according to police records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The legalization of marijuana is a hot issue in Boxer’s senatorial race as well as other California elections. California Democrats have been largely divided over Proposition 19, a ballot question that would legalize marijuana and allow the government to impose taxes on pot. Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) have been opposed to the measure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is not the first time a member of Boxer’s senior staff has been arrested. Senior policy adviser Jeffrey Rosato, who also worked on the EPW committee, was fired in 2008 after he was arrested and charged with the receipt and distribution of child pornography. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stanley is the fourth Hill aide to be arrested by Capitol Police this year, according to an analysis by POLITICO.","Oops. An economics adviser to Barbara Boxer got caught trying to sneak some pot into a DC Senate office building and promptly resigned.

Boxer, incidentally, opposes that, as does rival Carly Fiorina, notes the San Francisco Chronicle. Boxer's office terse statement: ""Marcus Stanley is no longer with this office. He submitted his resignation and Senator Boxer accepted it because his actions yesterday were wrong and unacceptable."" And in a weird footnote to the story, Politico notes that no fewer than a dozen people have been arrested for trying to sneak drugs into the Capitol complex in the past year and a half.

"Jared Fogle is desperately trying to get out of prison anyway he can, and now he is dragging disgraced Larry Nassar into his fight by using the disgraced Team USA doctor as a benchmark for his own charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fogle filed documents in his case, obtained by The Blast, arguing that he should have never been charged with “traveling for the purpose of engaging in illicit sex.” He specifically points out that “Dr. Larry Nasser was not charged with ‘travel for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct,’ yet he clearly engaged in unlawful conducts with young women.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He says that “Fogle, in contrast, traveled as a Media Spokesperson for Subway, yet he was in error allowed to be charged” with the “traveling” crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fogle — who is currently behind bars serving his 15 year sentence — is questioning why Nassar wouldn’t also be charged with the same crime if he was “clearly violating young women” during his medical travels. He claims this is “diverging applications of the law,” and wants it dropped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fogle is also claiming he was pressured into pleading guilty in the whole case, and wants his plea withdrawn from court. He accuses the prosecution of “tinkering” with a charge to “create crime” and force him to plead guilty or risk being forced into bankruptcy. He also blames his “high priced” legal team for allegedly forcing him to plead guilty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lastly, he blames many of his issues on “alcohol and sex addictions” and claims doctors put him on medication to successfully curb his “overactive libido.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fogle is adamant the courts have been in “grave error of the law.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The court has not yet responded to his motion … but Fogle is clearly pulling out all the stops to get out of prison.

Nassar was traveling with Team USA Gymnastics when he committed some of his crimes. Fogle, who filed the docs himself, thinks there was some bias against him because he did get that charge. He thinks he and Nassar should have gotten equal treatment under the law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's why Fogle's not a great lawyer. Just one of Nassar's several sentences was for 175 years -- whereas Fogle's doing 15. He's asking the court to let him withdraw his guilty plea, presumably to get a do-over in his case.

Fogle apparently sees this as an example of how the case against him was unfair. He also says he was pressured into pleading guilty and wants to withdraw his pleas to charges of distribution and receipt of child pornography and traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor. TMZ points out that Fogle is serving a 15-year sentence, while Nassar has no hope of ever leaving prison, raising the question of why Fogle would take the risk of withdrawing his pleas to get a new trial.

Instead, thanks to the hard work of everyday Californians and a precipitation-filled winter that partly restocked the area's reservoirs and mountain snowpacks, the State Water Resources Control Board is rolling back its rules on keeping tabs on how long people shower or water their lawns, allowing local communities to come up with their own conservation methods.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The diver had not yet weighed out, but handlers expected him to lose about 30 pounds from lack of food. He was on only liquids during the dive.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked to describe Hall as he emerged, the trainer replied, ""He's very, very cold, very wrinkled and gray."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From the dive platform, Hall had told his team he wanted ""a hot dog, a beer and a hot shower"" as soon as he got out of the lake.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His Giants have yet to play the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI, but the rookie linebacker won the biggest battle of his life when he overcame Ewing’s sarcoma, a type of bone cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That story of survival led Herzlich to tweet this message upon the Giants’ Monday night arrival at Indianapolis International Airport: “2 yrs ago I was told I might never walk again. Just WALKED off plane in Indy to play in The #SuperBowl. #TakeThat**** Cancer.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was very pleased and very happy that so many people got to see it because that’s part of what my goal is and what my mission is,” Herzlich said Tuesday at Media Day. “This week’s all about football and all about playing, but there are people that are out there going through cancer right now and saying, ‘He’s doing it. I can do it.’ … NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a real privilege and a blessing to play in it. I’ve come from a different, tough place in my life with being sick, and just two short years later, to be able to play in the Super Bowl, that’s great.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Herzlich, football was the second-biggest motivator, only behind his family, in his battle with cancer. He even made a highlight tape of himself from Boston College’s 2008 season to help him “through the bad days” of chemotherapy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since he was a Boston College student at the time of his diagnosis, Herzlich received a lot of support in New England. Although most of those fans will pull for the Patriots on Sunday, a few likely will cheer for Herzlich, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s interesting to have Boston fans root for any sort of Giant, but I appreciate everything, and the support I got all through school was unbelievable,” Herzlich said. “Even today, I got tweets from people saying, ‘I am a Patriots fan.

He was thankful not just to be there, but to be alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""2 yrs ago I was told I might never walk again. Just WALKED off plane in Indy to play in The #SuperBowl. #TakeThatSh*tCancer,"" he tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2009, Herzlich was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. The cancer was isolated to his left leg and the initial prognosis was not positive for the promising Boston College football star. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""They felt the NFL was a long shot,"" Herzlich's father, Sandy, told ESPN last summer. ""They were first happy if they could save his life and they were happy if they could save his leg."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herzlich was told there were three possible outcomes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""The worst-case scenario is obviously [that] it gets into other parts of your body and it completely kills you,"" he told ESPN. ""Second worst-case scenario is if they saw a small fracture in the bone and it was seeping out. Then they would have to amputate my leg right away within hours of finding it out. … Then better than that would be to remove that portion of the leg, putting in a cadaver bone and being in a cast for six months from the waist down, not ever being able to run again."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It turns out there was a fourth and even better option. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herzlich responded phenomenally to aggressive chemotherapy and radiation. He was given the choice to forgo surgery and continue treatment, saving his football career, but increasing the likelihood that the cancer could return, or have surgery, ending his football aspirations, but likely eliminating the cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herzlich decided to keep his dream alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After missing the 2009 college football season to undergo treatment, he took the field for Boston College in 2010. He started in all 13 games, but did not catch the eye of NFL scouts and went undrafted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herzlich continued training and eventually signed as a free agent with the New York Giants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, one year into his NFL career he's walked off the plane in Indianapolis and is getting ready to run onto the field at Lucas Oil Stadium, two things, that just three years ago seemed nearly impossible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ESPN contributed to this report.","Rookie Giants linebacker Mark Herzlich is happier than most to be playing in the Super Bowl: “2 yrs ago I was told I might never walk again. Just WALKED off plane in Indy to play in the Super Bowl. Take That Sh*t Cancer,"" Herzlich tweeted after arriving in Indianapolis yesterday. Herzlich was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer in 2009. He had been expected to be a first-round draft pick from Boston College, but instead spent the year undergoing treatment, choosing chemotherapy and radiation over a leg amputation that would have ended his dream of playing in the NFL, ABC reports. Herzlich, who went undrafted and joined the Giants as a free agent this season, says he sees his arrival in Indianapolis to take on the New England Patriots as an opportunity to inspire.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. drugmaker said on Tuesday it was working on plans to launch the non-prescription version of the medicine, known as Viagra Connect, in the United Kingdom in the spring of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug will only be available in pharmacies and its supply will depend on pharmacists’ assessment of its suitability for each individual. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Viagra has been one of the pharmaceutical industry’s most successful prescription products since its launch in 1998, following a serendipitous discovery of its effects by researchers who had been studying it as a heart medicine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It achieved peak worldwide sales of more than $2 billion in 2012 but sales have since declined as patents have expired, prompting Pfizer to explore extending its brand value as a non-prescription drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Viagra is so far the only erectile dysfunction medicine to be reclassified from “prescription only medicine” to “pharmacy” status in Britain. The change follows a lengthy review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pfizer will continue to make Viagra available as a prescription drug but the option of also buying it over-the-counter is likely to reduce demand for potentially ineffective and dangerous fakes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s important men feel they have fast access to quality and legitimate care, and do not feel they need to turn to counterfeit online supplies which could have potentially serious side effects,” said Mick Foy, the MHRA’s group manager in vigilance and risk management of medicines.  TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.K. is set to be the first country to allow over-the-counter sales of the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, after the medication was reclassified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead of going to see a doctor, men over the age of 18 will be able to obtain the drug after a conversation with a pharmacist. “Erectile dysfunction can be a debilitating condition, so it’s important men feel they have fast access to quality and legitimate care,” said Mick Foy of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the body that made the decision. A four-pack of the drug, the formal name for which is Sildenafil, will cost around £20 ($27). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pfizer, the U.S. pharmaceutical company that manufactures the drug, said it had plans to launch a non-prescription version of Viagra in spring 2018, according to Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The MRHA made the decision to deregulate the drug after a public consultation, and said it hoped the rule change would reduce the number of people buying counterfeit versions of the drug, which can be dangerous. The agency said that it had seized over £50m ($67m) of unlicensed and counterfeit erectile dysfunction medications in the past five years.","For the first time ever, Viagra will be available over the counter and without a prescription. Reuters reports Pfizer plans to start selling an over-the-counter version of the erectile dysfunction medication this spring in the UK. The new Viagra Connect will have the same major ingredient as regular Viagra, according to Fortune. Sales of Viagra have been declining since 2012, and Pfizer hopes an over-the-counter version will open a new revenue channel. The drug maker has been pushing for the UK to reclassify Viagra as a non-prescription drug for nearly a decade. That finally happened courtesy of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Time reports. “Erectile dysfunction can be a debilitating condition, so it’s important men feel they have fast access to quality and legitimate care,” says Mick Foy of the MHRA. The agency hopes allowing anyone over the age of 18 to purchase Viagra at the pharmacy will reduce the number of people who buy dangerous counterfeit erectile dysfunction medication. Viagra Connect is the first non-prescription erectile dysfunction medication in the UK. It will cost approximately $27 for a four-pack."

Ballas explained that she was ""preparing for the schedule that lays ahead,"" which may have meant their appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live (in which Palin asked Kimmel to apologize for all his jokes about her mother). Ballas also said he was ""really proud"" of his partner.

U.S. cell phone users donated more than $8 million by 8:25 a.m. EDT Friday in a Haiti earthquake relief text message appeal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The donations were pledged in $10 increments to the Red Cross for Haiti disaster relief, by far the largest outpouring of support via mobile devices in history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The response to the devastating earthquake produced the highest amount of mobile donations ""that we have ever seen,"" said Jenifer Snyder, executive director of mGive Foundation, the nonprofit group that is working with the Red Cross and wireless carriers to channel the donations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To donate to the Red Cross, mobile users are texting the word ""Haiti"" to the number 90999. Snyder said the money is coming in at a rate of roughly $200,000 an hour. As of Thursday afternoon, people had donated $5.1 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We could be handling more,"" she said. ""We are not at capacity."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Red Cross spokesman Roger Lowe called the outpouring of $10 donations by hundreds of thousands of mobile users ""nothing short of awe-inspiring.""

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday morning's ""The Early Show"" on CBS, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton asked Americans to contribute to the Red Cross via text donations. And on social networks Twitter and Facebook, users continued to urge one another to text money as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other charities, such as singer Wyclef Jean's Yele, were also collecting mobile donations. To send $5, donors can text ""Yele"" to the number 501501. The William J. Clinton Foundation was accepting $10 per text from users sending the word ""Haiti"" to 20222. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Verizon Wireless said Thursday morning its users have pledged more than $1 million to the Red Cross through text donations. The outpouring easily surpassed earlier records for mobile giving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Red Cross collected $400,000 from mobile users. A year earlier, following the Asian tsunami that left 230,000 people dead, the organization received $200,000 through text messages, Verizon Wireless said, citing industrywide figures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless, called mobile donations a ""new stream of philanthropy."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""So many folks who are texting $10 now might not have been at a place to write a check, or call a toll-free number or send mail,"" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wireless carriers, including AT&T, Verizon Wireless and Sprint, said they were not charging regular text-messaging fees on top of the donations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR T-Mobile USA Inc., which is also waiving texting fees, said Thursday it is enabling international calls to Haiti free of charge through Jan. 31 and will retroactively credit accounts for such calls made since Tuesday. And T-Mobile users in Haiti will be able to make roaming calls on local networks Voila and Digicel thorough the end of the month, the company said.

(Thanks to Mathew for the heads up.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MSNBC asked Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T;, and Sprint whether or not they're charging for the popular ""text HAITI to 90999 to donate $10"" meme that's been going around online for the past two days, and that so far has raked in over three million dollars. Verizon and T-Mobile say they're not. Sprint says they are, but that if you just upgrade to an unlimited text message package then you won't have to worry about it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What makes this even more ridiculous is that text messaging costs carriers next to nothing—it's almost pure profit. AT&T; and Sprint have apparently decided that they'd like to get in on the Haiti disaster and make a little something something off of the goodwill of their customers. My suggestion: if you're an AT&T; or a Sprint customer, donate some other way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: I'd take readers who stand up for companies more seriously if I saw more evidence that they thought like companies. A business like AT&T; should have known from the start that making those messages free, and then crowing about it softly via the magic of PR, would be good for the brand, and that means good for profits. The fact that two competitors did just that shows me that some carriers were indeed thinking about long-term self interest, and how to turn public tragedy into a plus sum scenario for the greater good as well as the company. AT&T; and Sprint just weren't. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""Mobile giving to help Haiti exceeds $3 million"" [MSNBC] (Thanks to Matthew!)
