"A Picasso painting that was found to have vanished from a Paris museum more than a decade ago has turned up—in the US, in a package shipped from Belgium. Its papers identified it as a $37 ""art craft/toy"" and also included the line ""Joyeux Noel,"" or Merry Christmas, the New York Times reports. A man named ""Robert"" attempted to send the package to a climate-controlled warehouse in Queens, New York, in December, but custom officials at the Port of Newark seized what turned out to be Picasso's 1911 La Coiffeuse (The Hairdresser). French museum officials traveled to New York last month and confirmed the find is indeed the missing Picasso work, which the Centre Georges Pompidou realized was missing from its storerooms in 2001 following a loan request; it was then valued at more than $2.5 million.

"The Wall Street Journal today takes a look at the life and death of 94 little words: the heavily edited and ultimately faulty Benghazi talking points compiled by the CIA in the wake of the consulate attack. Just a day after the attack, the CIA's reports were already referencing al-Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb. The following day, David Petraeus appeared before House and Senate groups; he, too, mentioned the terrorists, and was asked to compile unclassified talking points that Congress could use. By noon on Sept. 14, a draft was circulating—and it referenced al-Qaeda. But an exhausting process of editing followed, with more than two dozen CIA officials weighing in on the copy over email—and battling about the inclusion of al-Qaeda. Those opposed argued it should be removed because the intel was shaky (sourced from intercepted phone calls) and over fears it could alert al-Qaeda members to the fact that they were being watched. The opponents won out, though the term ""extremists"" remained; the FBI agreed with the call. It also contained this line: ""The demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the US Embassy in Cairo."" On Sept. 15, the CIA station chief in Tripoli began to voice his concern with the assertions that the attack was both spontaneous and that demonstrations were occurring. He sent the CIA an email summarizing his thoughts the next day—but Susan Rice had already been hand-delivered the 94 fateful words the night before, so that she could prep for her news show appearances.

"When Deena Murphy and Timothy Sullivan wanted to renovate their Raleigh, NC, rental property, they didn't want a DIY project, so they did what they thought was the next best thing: signed up to have an HGTV show do it for them. But per a lawsuit the couple has now filed against Big Coat, the production company behind Love It or List It, as well as the local contractor who overhauled the home, they were left with ""disastrous work,"" including holes in the floor and windows painted shut, the Charlotte Observer reports. The suit also alleges the ""reality-TV"" program is ""scripted, with 'roles' and reactions assigned to the various performers and participants, including the homeowners."" And the show's hosts, designer Hilary Farr and real estate agent David Visentin, and its resident general contractor? ""Actors or television personalities … [who don't play] more than a casual role in the actual renovation process."" Per their contract with Big Coat, the couple deposited $140,000 that would be used to pay Aaron Fitz Construction and its subcontractors. About $85,000 was distributed to Aaron Fitz during the overhaul, even though Murphy and Sullivan say they expressed concerns about mediocre reviews seen on Angie's List. The rest of the money got pumped into producing the show, the couple claims, reports Today.com. They say the show is ""even more of a scam than it generally seems,"" as the AV Club frames it. ""The homeowners' funds essentially pay the cost of creating a stage set for this television series,"" the suit says. A statement from Big Coat's CEO says the company will ""vigorously defend what we consider to be false allegations.""

The Raleigh News & Observer says that Deena Murphy and Timothy Sullivan agreed to participate in the hit HGTV series under the guise that they were considering a move to a rental property with their teenage foster children. The problem, according to the suit against Big Coat TV and Aaron Fitz Construction, was that the show’s principals—designer Hilary Farr, real estate agent David Visentin, and contractor Eric Eremita—are “actors or television personalities playing a role for the camera,” not people who “played more than a casual role in the actual renovation process.” While this shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s ever suffered through Farr and Visentin’s bullshit “no, you are” banter, it’s still mildly disheartening to hear. Over the course of the renovations, only $85,780.50 was disbursed to Fitz, leaving the couple wondering where the rest of their money went.

"Amid rising nuclear tensions, two figure skaters Friday became the first North Korean athletes to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics, which will be held just 40 miles south of the demilitarized zone in South Korea, CNN reports. According to the New York Times, 18-year-old Ryom Tae-Ok and 25-year-old Kim Ju-Sik, who have been training in Canada with a French coach, finished with a score of 180.09 at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany. It was a career-best performance in an international competition for the pair. Kim says they were motivated by their coaches and the people cheering for them. Ryom agreed: ""There were many people of different nationalities and backgrounds cheering for us. The fact that we gave them some kind of joy, that was the best part in the performance."" While Kim and Ryom's sixth place finish in Germany was enough to nab them one of the final spots in February's Olympics, it remains unclear if they'll actually compete, Reuters reports. The decision rests with the North Korea Olympic Committee. Both South Korea and the International Olympic Committee have been pushing for North Korean athletes to participate in the Games, hoping it will be a diplomatic balm for the countries. The IOC has been providing travel, equipment, and accommodation to North Korean athletes attempting to qualify (North Korean skiers and speed skaters still have a shot), and South Korea's president said North Korea will have as much time as possible to decide if it will participate. North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in South Korea, but it did send a women's hockey team and taekwondo team to competitions in South Korea this year.","NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korean speed skaters and Nordic skiers could join the figure skaters with their own qualifiers coming up.

"The mysteries of Old Faithful may soon be solved, thanks, in part, to something that looks like a giant hula hoop. American and Danish scientists have this week begun an aerial survey of Yellowstone that actually looks well into the earth, ""visualizing"" the geology and water as much as 1,500 feet below the surface, says Carol Finn.

Scientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth, ""rotten"" sulfuric rock, or water lurks below, which could assist in identifying unstable areas, per Wyoming Public Media. But a press release frames the main quest like so: We know that the water that explodes from Yellowstone's geysers ""originates as old precipitation, snow and rain that percolates down into the crust, is heated, and ultimately returns to the surface."" We know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. ""Does it travel down and back up?

"Charlie Sheen's HIV diagnosis was joked about in an email exposed, but never publicized, during last year's Sony hack, the Washington Post reports.

"A university has admitted to misplacing a gram of weapons-grade plutonium, and federal authorities want to fine them $8,500. Per CNN, Idaho State University has not been able to account for the bit of radioactive material since 2003 but, nonetheless, believes it was properly stored at a licensed disposal facility. However, with no documented proof, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday it must propose the fine. Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. ""Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,"" he said in a statement to the AP. The statement said the plutonium ""poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety."" The plutonium was being used to develop ways to ensure nuclear waste containers weren't leaking and to find ways to detect radioactive material being illegally brought into the US following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While the missing amount could not be used to make a nuclear bomb, it could be used to create a so-called dirty bomb to spread nuclear contamination. The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency said a school employee doing a routine inventory discovered the university could only account for 13 of its 14 plutonium sources, each weighing about the same small amount.","The substance had been used by the school to conduct several research experiments.

"It's going to take decades to completely decommission the Fukushima nuclear power plant, but a critical step in that process began in earnest today, reports NBC News. One of the six 136-foot covers draped over one of the plant's nuclear reactors to keep radioactive materials from seeping out is being painstakingly removed. Tepco officials say it will take till the end of 2016 to pry all six covers off, and till at least 2020 to remove the nearly 300 spent fuel rods lurking underneath. The project, which was supposed to commence last July, was previously postponed because of fears of radiation escaping. ""For the safety of Fukushima's residents, we would like the work to proceed with extra care,"" says the chief of a group of monitors overseeing the project. The total cost and time for the entire decommissioning assignment: tens of billions of dollars over 30 years or so, NBC notes. Meanwhile, the Japanese government today approved an increase in compensation payments to Tepco to a total of $57.2 billion, Reuters reports. That's $7.7 billion added onto the $49.5 billion in taxpayer-funded aid that Tepco had previously been approved to receive.

"There's no doubt about it: The human body goes through major changes in youth and old age. And these biological and social changes may be the reasons behind what researchers are calling less stable personalities at those life stages. In fact, according to a study of almost 4,000 New Zealanders between the ages of 20 and 80, the stability of one's personality increases through youth and into middle age and peaks in our 50s, before we slide back into less stable versions of ourselves, reports Research Digest. As the Smithsonian puts it, ""in some ways, our 80-year-old selves mirror our 20-year-old selves."" Some traits peaked at different times; the most stable traits in one's 30s are extraversion and neuroticism, while in the late 40s and early 50s it is openness, honesty-humility, and conscientiousness. The only trait that showed ""gradually reduced stability"" throughout life was agreeableness; apparently we are simply less and less agreeable as we pack the years on. Still, one's most basic personality—introvert vs. extrovert, for example—tends to remain consistent throughout one's life, even if the stability of traits waxes and wanes, notes the Smithsonian. (Other researchers have even calculated the country's most extroverted city.)","Crawls performed by Internet Archive on behalf of the National Library of Australia. This data is currently not publicly accessible. What we might see as personality changes are actually just responses to external factors, such as getting a job, getting married or becoming a parent.

If that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: A 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last January found 41% sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that ""injuries are very common in experienced vaulters."" The injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? Vice talked to US record-holder Brad Walker (one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters), who sums up vaulters as ""risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves ... you won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose."" As for why they stay with it, Vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: As you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast. Walker says you need ""significant body control and spatial awareness,"" too.","This site uses cookies. Find out more. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms of injury so that preventive strategies can be implemented. Information was obtained by means of a telephone interview with someone familiar with the accident. Three common mechanisms were identified: 17 (53%) athletes landed with their body on the landing pad and their head on the surrounding hard ground, 8 (25%) landed in the vault box after being stranded at the height of the jump, and 5 (16%) completely missed the landing pad. Increasing the minimum landing pad size and enforcing the rule requiring soft surfaces adjacent to the landing pads are the primary recommendations for preventing injuries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Purpose: To describe injury incidence, patterns, and risks in collegiate pole vaulters. Baseline athlete information was collected on study enrollment. Injuries were recorded in a standardized form to document diagnosis and event circumstances. The mechanism of injury in the remaining two athletes was unknown. Injury incidence was reported as the proportion of injured vaulters and number of new injuries per 1000 athlete-exposures. The low back was the most common injury location (16.7%), followed by the hamstrings and lower leg (13.9% each). Thirty percent, including 83% of low back injuries, occurred during the plant/takeoff phase of the vault."

"Apparently you can credit Amalia Damonte for Jorge Bergoglio becoming Pope Francis—or perhaps her father, reports the Week. When Bergoglio was just 12, he had a young ""romance"" with Damonte, writing a letter saying they would be married and drawing a picture of the house they would live in. She said he vowed to become a priest if Amalia, who lived near him in a Buenos Aires suburb, rejected the offer. However, Damonte's father wasn't about to stand for his 12-year-old daughter talking to boys, and slapped her for starting to write back. ""I never saw him after that—my parents kept me away from him and did everything possible to separate us,"" says Damonte, adding that ""it was a thing between children and totally pure.""

"The Pentagon is digging deeper in its push for new air and space technologies as China threatens to unseat the US as king of the skies.

Specifically, China is developing highly advanced radar-evading aircraft, reconnaissance planes, missiles, and electronic warfare equipment, Work says, suggesting the US needs to step up its game. That’s becoming increasingly difficult, however, as ""the margin of technological superiority upon which we have become so accustomed ... is steadily eroding,"" Work says.

"The best wedding present Kathy and Brandon Gunn received at their Michigan wedding was one they never opened—at least not for nine years. That was because the gift from great-aunt Alison came with a special instruction: ""On the plain white box was a card that read, 'Do not open until your 1st disagreement,'"" Kathy Gunn wrote in a post on the Love What Matters Facebook page, spotted by UPI. “Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments, and slammed doors throughout our 9 years,"" writes Gunn. ""There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up ... but we never opened the box."" Doing that, she says, ""would have symbolized our failure.""

"""I'm a born burglar,"" says Octave Durham, per the New York Times, which looks at a new documentary about Durham's notorious theft of two Vincent Van Gogh paintings. Set to be broadcast Tuesday on Dutch TV, the 45-minute special by filmmaker Vincent Verweij gets the inside scoop on the 2002 heist Durham says took less than four minutes and nabbed him two works the Times deems ""of inestimable value"": Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen and View of the Sea at Scheveningen. Durham, who was convicted for the burglary in 2004 and spent just over two years in prison, says he passed cops in his getaway car and brags that he'd pulled off ""more spectacular jobs than this""—after years of denying he had any involvement in the theft, per Versopolis.com. In one reveal that may insult art lovers everywhere, Durham notes he didn't run off with the Van Goghs because of any particular love for the great master, or for art in general: He did it because it was an opportunity for a big get. ""That's the eye of a burglar,"" he says. Per NLTimes.com, Durham told a Dutch paper over the weekend he'd wanted to steal two other Van Gogh paintings—Sunflowers and The Potato Eaters—but one was too big to slip out and the other was under heavy security, so he and partner Henk Bieslijn settled on the other two. The Times notes the Van Gogh Museum is still ""furious"" with Durham, who didn't get paid for the film, and refused to help Verweij. The filmmaker defends his choice of cinematic subject, noting, ""You never see documentaries or articles about art theft from the perspective of the thief."" (The Van Gogh Museum was pretty stoked when the paintings were recovered.)","“That’s the eye of a burglar,” he boasts.

"Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is President Trump's pick to permanently lead the beleaguered department.

Trump revealed his decision during a prison reform event at the White House. Trump previously nominated White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson for the job, but Jackson withdrew last month. Politico sees Wilkie's path to confirmation as much smoother than Jackson's, though it points out one potential wrinkle: Wilkie was one of three congressional aides present when Trump's campaign supported ditching a provision in the GOP's 2016 platform that called for tough action against Russia.

"If you think it takes a liter of water to fill a liter water bottle, the International Bottled Water Association has news for you: It takes more than that. NPR reports on the group's first look at the topic, which found that 1.39 liters (or 47 ounces) are needed to make a one-liter bottle (that's about 34 ounces of water); this includes product water and the water needed for things like cleaning and bottling. It arrived at that figure by asking its members to submit three years of detailed data, touching on factors like total water use and the type of treatment used. Writes IBWA, ""The study represents 14.5 million liters of bottled water production, an impressive 43% of total 2011 United States bottled water consumption."" That figure applies to US and Canadian companies, and a rep for the group actually calls that ""extremely efficient."" NPR explains why: A liter of soda demands 2.02 liters of water, while the same quantity of wine requires 4.74 liters. The IBWA chose to stop there in its calculations, but the truth is that the actual ""water footprint"" is much larger: For instance, oil is needed to make plastic, and drilling for it requires, yep, water—in some cases as much as seven times what the plastic bottle ultimately contains.","Usually, they point to the roughly 50 billion (mostly plastic) bottles we throw away every year. Hard alcohol, it turns out, is the greediest, guzzling 34.55 liters of water for every liter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But water activists say the IBWA study highlights a problem throughout the beverage industry: Few companies take the whole water-use picture into account when calculating their water use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This, the bottled water industry says, is evidence that its product isn't so bad. In other words, the amount of water going into making the bottle could be up to six or seven times what's inside the bottle.

"Picture the average American couple in the 1960s. Now picture the average American couple today. Something more than questionable fashion should stand out, according to new data from the CDC, which finds the average weight of a US woman is now 166.2 pounds—about the same weight as the average man in the 1960s—up from about 140 pounds during that time, reports the Washington Post. That's an increase of 18.5%. Men, who weighed 166.3 pounds in the 1960s, now tip the scales at an average of 195.5 pounds, for a 17.6% gain. Is it as bad as it seems? Essentially, yes, though the typical height of men and women has grown by an inch, which at least accounts for something. But the main reasons for our growing bellies are no surprise: Americans are eating more food, but less health food, and are exercising less. The data shows 35% of Americans over 20 are considered obese, while 69% of adults are either overweight or obese, reports CBS Atlanta. As for children, one in five between 12 and 19 and 18% between 6 and 11 are obese. A 2012 study found Americans were the third-heaviest people on the planet behind residents of Tonga and Micronesia. The average American was 33 pounds heavier than a Frenchman, 40 pounds heavier than a citizen of Japan, and 70 pounds heavier than a person in Bangladesh, adds the Post. Dying to get back to that 1960s frame? It's actually more important to watch what you eat rather than exercise constantly, though exercising and eating healthy together is obviously beneficial. The New York Times notes that 30 minutes of jogging achieves the same calorie reduction as cutting back on two 16-ounce sodas.

Chris Baldridge tells the Washington Post that when Trump called a few weeks after his son, Army Sgt.

"Michael Bay's latest movie is a bit of a shift from Transformers—it's a smaller-budget film based on a true story about bodybuilders who get involved in kidnapping.

""But its biggest lift comes from the pumped-up (Mark) Wahlberg and (Dwayne) Johnson.

Pumped-up, aggressive, muscle-headed entertainment is Mr. Bay’s specialty, after all, and while this grisly true-crime drama is partly about performance-enhancing drugs and the bulky men who love them, it is also, compared with “Armageddon” or the “Transformers” series, a stripped-down, modest enterprise in which no major American city is reduced to rubble.

He says that he wants to be just like everybody else but also that he wants to set himself apart from the losers and suckers in whose ranks he unfairly languishes. Rather than demand ransom, they decide to torture him into signing his assets over to them. Victor is enough of a jerk that it is hard to feel too bad when Daniel enlists two fellow gym rats — Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul (Dwayne Johnson) — to kidnap him.

The BBC notes hippos are responsible for more human deaths in Africa than any other big animal. The suspect could be hit with a misdemeanor charge or other infraction—California law bars anyone from climbing into zoo enclosures—but the case is being investigated as a trespassing violation, not an animal cruelty one, as the animals didn't seem particularly fazed by the incident.","Learn more  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

"He might have been the most famous American in North Korea. But now James ""Joe"" Dresnok, a US soldier who defected after fighting in the Korean War, is dead, reports the Guardian. His two Korean-born sons made the news public in a government video, saying their father had suffered a stroke and died at age 74. Dresnok was one of a few American soldiers to cross into North Korea in 1962, and he went on to star in propaganda films, generally as the evil American. The BBC made a documentary about him in 2006 called Crossing the Line in which he said he had no regrets about his defection. ""I wouldn't trade it for nothin,'"" the native of Richmond, Va., says in the video. (The film is on YouTube. CBS' 60 Minutes also did a feature on Dresnok, which can be seen here.) The few other Americans who defected are believed to have died or left the country. Dresnok, who crossed a minefield into the North, had faced a court-martial for leaving his base without permission for a night on the town. ""I was fed up with my childhood, my marriage, my military life, everything,"" he said. Sons Ted and James Dresnok, aka Hong Soon-chol and Hong Chol, spoke of their father in the new state video. ""Our father was in the arms of the republic and received only the love and care of the party until his passing at age 74,"" said Ted Dresnok. Though half-American himself, Ted Dresnok showed where his loyalties lie, warning that if war breaks out, ""we will not miss the opportunity and wipe the land of the US from the earth for ever.""

"Saturn's moon Titan, which happens to be larger than the planet Mercury, is cold. Very cold. As in -290 degrees Fahrenheit is not out of the ordinary. These super low temps, combined with an atmosphere roughly 1.5 times as dense as Earth's, have resulted in a few extraordinary bodies of liquid methane and ethane, reports Extreme Tech, and scientists are anxious to explore their depths. (In fact, Titan is the only body aside from Earth to boast liquid lakes on its surface.) So NASA is working up a (very early) model of a submarine drone that could do just that—one that CNET reports will likely be nuclear-powered, weigh a ton, and come equipped with a seafloor camera, sampling system, and other fancy futuristic robotic accoutrements. But don't get too excited just yet. First, this is a fully automated mission: ""Even if it were possible for humans to go swimming in Titan's seas,"" notes CNET, it ""would be something like swimming in a freezing ocean of liquefied natural gas."" Hence, NASA's goal of sending the ""highly capable science craft"" to Titan's largest sea, Kraken Mare, around the year 2040, in what it calls ""an unprecedented planetary exploration mission."" Many details remain to be sorted out, including how to get the craft to Titan (Boeing's X-37 is a possibility), how to land it (parachute drop), and while there, how to communicate with Earthlings (planar phased-array antenna). (Something else on Titan has been stumping NASA.)","Verne saw us flying around the world, traveling to the center of the Earth (not a great idea, it turns out) and to the moon, but I bet he never imagined that just 110 years after his death, we'd be working on a robot submarine to probe the flammable seas of a distant world. The team behind it anticipates that it might not splashdown until sometime around 2047. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this month, NASA published the below video introducing its concept submarine designed to explore Kraken Mare, one of the methane seas on Titan, the remarkably strange moon circling Saturn. The space plane would make a soft water landing on Kraken Mare and jettison the sub, or possibly drop it at low altitude via a parachute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Titan sub concept is very preliminary at this point, but there's plenty of time to work on it. Titan’s temperature can reach a positively frigid -179 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit). The aptly (though unimaginatively) named Titan Submarine Phase I Conceptual Design could some day go for a dip in the hydrocarbon lakes of Saturn’s moon Titan. The atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and methane with hints of hydrogen, so certainly nothing that would support life as we know it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getting the sub to Titan presents a bit of challenge since it won't fit into the sphere-cone shaped landers that have typically been used for planetary exploration in the past. The massive hydrocarbon lake has an area of 400,000 sq km (154,000 sq miles) and is believed to be as much as 160 meters (525 feet) deep. There are also currents and tides to deal with, and it’s not like mission control could just nudge the submersible this way or that whenever it needed. The NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program has developed a concept for a robotic submersible vehicle for planetary exploration, but it won’t be deployed in water. Real time control is out of the question. Titan is far from the Sun, making solar power inefficient, and the sub would spend most of its time beneath the surface where solar panels wouldn’t work anyway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA engineers estimate the Titan Submarine would weigh in at about one ton and make use of electrically-powered turbines to get around the liquid methane lake. It would surface for 16 hours per day to beam data back before sinking once more beneath the methane waves."
"Archaeologists think they've found the first evidence of prisoners trying to dig their way out of a Nazi death camp. The find comes after more than a decade of excavations at the Sobibor camp in Poland; Nazis leveled the place after its prisoners revolted in 1943, LiveScience explains. In the course of their work, the team last month ""came across two rows of barbed wire,"" one archaeologist tells the Telegraph. ""Digging down we found the traces of the tunnel. It was about as wide as a human, and we were 99% certain that it was an escape tunnel."" The tunnel, found 5 feet below ground, runs an astonishing 32 feet, from under where one of the barracks once stood to the other side of the barbed wire. The Telegraph explains that the barracks in question would have housed the sonderkommando: prisoners tasked with bringing victims to—and bodies out of—the gas chambers. Having avoided an immediate death, archaeologists speculate they would have had time to work on the tunnel. There's no evidence of whether it was actually used.","NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeologists say the passageway, found 5 feet (1.5 meters) below the surface, spanned 32 feet (10 m) and reached beyond the barbed-wire border surrounding the extermination camp at Sobibor, The Telegraph reported. ""Digging down we found the traces of the tunnel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the uprising, Nazi officials leveled the camp and covered its traces. It was about as wide as a human, and we are 99 percent certain that it was an escape tunnel."" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tunnel's discoverers believe it is unlikely that anybody ever used it to escape the camp.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ""We were excavating near where the sonderkommando barrack was and we came across two rows of buried barbed wire,"" Polish archaeologist Wojciech Mazurek was quoted as saying by The Telegraph. There were no reports of successful escape attempts from Sobibor until 600 prisoners broke out during an armed uprising in October 1943. Many of the 300 laborers who broke out of the extermination camp were eventually captured and killed, and only 50 escapees are believed to have survived the war. Six-hundred prisoners revolted and managed to kill nearly a dozen of their guards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Few people survived Sobibor.

"A pretty dismal number on today's jobs report: Just 74,000 jobs were created in December, the smallest monthly increase in three years; economists had expected 200,000. And while the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% from 7.0%, it was ""for all the wrong reasons,"" writes Steven Russolillo at the Wall Street Journal. Specifically, the big drop can be explained by the fact that the participation rate fell to a new low of 62.8%, meaning fewer people were looking for work. The AP reports that cold weather could have played a role in the poor numbers, noting that construction firms cut 16,000 jobs—the largest drop in 20 months. One silver lining from the report: November's new jobs were revised upward to 241,000 from 203,000. And Russolillo writes that the same could happen here. ""Something doesn’t smell right. This jobs number is so far out of whack from the recent economic data that have come out. Jobs data have been getting stronger for months, not to mention improvements in growth, housing, and manufacturing figures. Don't be surprised if this report gets revised higher in the coming months.""","October’s gain was unrevised at 200,000. It is also down from 63.6% in December 2012.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jobless Rate: The December unemployment rate decreased to 6.7%, from 7.0% the prior month, but that was because more people dropped out of the workforce rather than found new jobs. The Labor Department on Friday reported December jobs gains were much lower than expected as the year ended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yearly Figures: For 2013, employers added an average of 182,000 jobs each month. Other strong gains came from the wholesale trade industry (15,000) and professional and business services (19,000). Construction firms cut 16,000 jobs, the biggest drop in 20 months. Some economists had predicted before the report that colder weather could be to blame. For the first half of 2013, payrolls expanded by 195,000 each month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Longer-run Trend: December’s mild advance held back longer-term averages. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively searching for work."

"Chelsey Ramer, a member of the Poarch Creek Band of Indians, wanted to wear an important symbol of her Native American heritage when she graduated from her Alabama high school last month: an eagle feather. But the principal of Escambia Academy denied her request; soon after the school distributed a dress code contract (which prohibits ""extraneous items"" worn during graduation) that seniors had to sign in order to walk during the ceremony. Chelsey didn't sign, walked anyway—feather attached to her cap's tassel—and now she's been fined $1,000, which she must pay if she wants to get her diploma and transcripts.

"Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign is brash and boisterous—and increasingly rough with the reporters covering it, reports Politico. In less than two months, there have been at least five incidents reporters have called unusually hostile, including a Norwegian reporter who says an aide threatened to break his arm. Bachmann's campaign says security is just doing what it needs to keep their candidate safe, but veteran reporters say her security is going too far, well beyond the norms for bigger and more controversial candidates' security. Bachmann's spokeswoman defended one guard, a retired Secret Service agent, who has particularly come under criticism for his rough style. “He’s guarded presidents and vice presidents and knows exactly what needs to be done,” she said. “When he gives a warning to whoever it may be, the person needs to heed the warning.” On the other hand, with celebrities calling Bachmann a ""bigot"" to her face—as Kathy Griffin recounted on her Monday appearance on Conan—perhaps her security feels the need to stand up for their candidate.","Increasingly, there is a third feature of a Bachmann appearance on the presidential trail: a staffer’s physical confrontation with a reporter.

Rick Perry was guarded by watchful Texas Rangers who gave the press and fair-goers broad latitude to talk and walk next to the governor. Bachmann, in contrast, raced through the fair in a golf cart; in a similar cart in Ames on Saturday, her bodyguard could be seen pushing away the hands of autograph-seeking supporters.

"Americans are generally pretty positive, or at least indifferent, about these United States. Public Policy Polling asked 1,200 people how they felt about each of the 50 states, and only five were viewed more unfavorably than favorably.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ll be missing the start of the French team because I can’t do anything for a week except keep the lens in and then take drops,” he said."

"An Italian WWII pilot who died battling US pilots 70 years ago has been found 13 feet underground, his remains still at the controls of a fighter plane armed with machine guns and cannons, Discovery reports. Lt. Guerrino Bortolani went down in a losing battle against Allied planes on March 11, 1944, and hit the ground so hard that he literally vanished into the countryside outside Padua in northern Italy. ""The crash site is now a cornfield,"" says a member of the wreck-hunting crew that found Bortolani. ""We were able to find the remains with the help of an elderly man, who on that day witnessed the fighter going into a nosedive and hit the ground."" Bortolani was flying the best Italian fighter plane (the Macchi C.205) in a squadron led by the renowned Italian ace Adriano Visconti. But they went up against a daunting strike by the Mediterranean Allied Strategic Air Force—which had sent 111 B-17 planes over Padua to drop more than 300 tons of bombs. Allies said the Axis defense was ""aggressive,"" but five German planes and four Italian planes went down. Bortolani was ""dutiful until the end,"" the Week notes, sitting on his closed parachute and wearing a ring given him by a fighter pilot academy. Wreck-hunters found several parts of the plane as well, including the tail wheel, control stick, and pieces of the engine. Bortolani is expected to have a proper burial once relatives are found.

"When do you get paid six figures to write a party planning book? When you’re Pippa Middleton, of course. Her Royal Hotness has officially signed a book deal worth more than $620,000 to write the guide, which will be out by next Christmas, the Telegraph reports. She was originally rumored to be in talks for a deal worth more than twice that amount, which, of course, led to some uproar. Hilariously, the Telegraph notes that Middleton’s book will be released after the Queen’s summertime Diamond Jubilee celebration so that Pippa “is not seen to be cashing in on her royal connections.” To be fair, she does have professional party planning experience, and she regularly contributes to her parents’ online party planning newsletter. That would totally get most normal people a book deal! The guide will reportedly include recipes and stories, as well as instructions for hosting many different events.","It will include recipes, anecdotes and details of how to throw a range of different types of event. It is understood that publisher Michael Joseph, an imprint of Penguin books, last week signed her up to a publishing deal worth £400,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She wanted to publish it next year, but it will be timed to come out after the Jubilee,” said one book industry insider. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She is keen for the book to be released next year but is determined that she is not seen to be making money from her closeness to the royal family. Book executives said that she went down a storm. The U.K. economy is not that great and to hand over money for a fluff piece written by someone related to Kate Middleton is ticking off a lot of Britons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book will be a guide to being the perfect party hostess. And etiquette, hmm. Wasn't she photographed dancing with a dude in her bra with bottles of booze in the background? Sounds fun, but ... that doesn't really necessarily display the characteristics of someone who's a supposed expert on manners, decorum, and propriety. Pippa seems better than that. She's a perma-tanned beauty and pseudo-royal who's in the spotlight because of her relatives, not because of her expertise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I'm not the only one who thinks this is a bad idea; not many people are fans of Pippa's alleged contract. And I'd have to agree that it's midly perturbing. Kate's coattails probably look like a lot of fun to ride, but she shouldn't hop on just because it's easy."

They still really care for each other.” Kelly’s rep confirmed the break-up to Popsugar. Guess this means all those engagement rumors weren’t true…","“But they remain friends.
